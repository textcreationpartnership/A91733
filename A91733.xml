            <p>Created by converting TCP files to TEI P5 using tcp2tei.xsl,
      TEI @ Oxford.
      </p>
         </projectDesc>
         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,368 texts created during Phase 1 of the project (2000-2009), initially available only to institutions that contributed to their creation, were released into the public domain on 1 January 2015. The approximately 40,000 texts produced during Phase 2 (2009- ), of which 34,963 had been released as of 2020, originally similarly restricted, were similarly freed from all restrictions on 1 August 2020. As of that date anyone is free to take and use these texts for any purpose (modify them, annotate them, distribute them, etc.). But we do respectfully request that due credit and attribution be given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <p>The good acceptance which my former book (en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>titled, <hi>Precepts for Chriſtian Practice, &amp;c.</hi>) hath, as I hear found with ſober-wel-minded Chriſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans, and the advice of ſome judicious friends, do in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courage mee to make this plain peece publick. Though Satan ſeeks to caſt an odium upon the holy and precious truths, wayes and ordinances of Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſus Chriſt; yea and upon the Books that are writ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten for the <hi>Declaration</hi> and <hi>Defence thereof,</hi> to bring them all into contempt. For Satan feareth that ſuch Books may do poor ſouls good and his cauſe hurt; which ſhould bee our indeavour to promote, as it is his deſign to hinder. This is a common Experiment, that as in <hi>Preaching,</hi> ſo in <hi>Printing;</hi> Satan and his Agents oppoſe that moſt, which may in probability, through Gods bleſſing, be inſtrumental for publick profit. But the God of Truth, who loveth Righteouſneſs, will throughly
<pb facs="tcp:120106:3"/>plead the cauſe of his own Truths and Wayes; and of the reproaches of his ſervants, from the Tongues and Pens of their enemies in due time. Yea the day approacheth wherein God will judge mens Hearts, Tongues and Books, according to his Goſpel. Then they who have ſpoken or written of the matters of God, and of his Miniſters, the thing that is <hi>true and right,</hi> ſhall bee approved; and thoſe that have done otherwiſe ſhall (to ſay no more) bee reproved. Books, as well as any other works may help men forward either to Heaven or to Hell; and advance their Salvation, or aggravate their condemnation. A man may do more good or more hurt by writing than by ſpeaking; becauſe, what is ſpoken is tran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſient, and paſſeth away; but what is written is per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manent, <hi>litera ſcripta manet,</hi> and ſpreads it ſelf further by far for time, place and perſons, than the voice can reach.</p>
            <p>All Chriſts ſervants who keep the word of his patience,
<note place="margin">Phil. 1.17.</note> are <hi>ſet for the defence of the Goſpel;</hi> and they muſt <hi>contend earneſtly</hi> (or,

Satan doth furiouſly drive on a Malevolent deſign to draw poor ſouls into deluſion, and thereby unto de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruction, by diſperſing ſcandalous, railing, Truth-perverting ſoul-poiſoning Pamphlets (which come forth of the Preſ<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

<note place="margin">Iſa. 44.5.</note> in the Preſs as in the Pulpit; and <hi>ſubſcribe with their hands unto the Lord,</hi> and to his truths and waies, as well as <hi>confeſs them with their mouths?</hi> Good books, that tend to build up all that read them, in faith, holineſs and obedience,
<note place="margin">Pſal. 46.4.</note> are like that <hi>River, the ſtreams whereof make glad the Citie of God;</hi>

<note place="margin">Mr. Cotton.</note> 
               <q>The Penning and Reading of godly Books (as a Reve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rend man of God, now with God, ſaid) is a ſingu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar improvement of the Communion of Saints; as whereby wee injoy ſweet and gracious conference with the Saints, though unknown to us, though abſent in place, and diſtant in time (yea many ages before us) and ſo partake in the Communi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of their moſt precious Gifts; as if they were preſent with us; or as if wee had been long ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quainted with them,</q> I doubt not but it hath been a cordial to ſome of Gods ſervants at death, to think and ſay to God in their <hi>manner and mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure,</hi> as Chriſt did in his — <hi>Father,
<note place="margin">Joh. 17.4.</note> I have glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rified thee on the Earth, I have done the work thou gaveſt mee to do,</hi> to wit, by writing as well as by speaking, by Books as by Sermons.</p>
            <p>When I had the former Treatiſe under my hand, this came into my mind, that to adde to the Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment
<pb facs="tcp:120106:4"/>of the Thoughts and of the Affections, ſome Rules for the Government of the Tongue might bee ſuitable, ſeaſonable and profitable. But I, labouring under ſome bodily Infirmities, laid the Thoughts thereof aſide; yet afterwards God revived them in mee, and made my ſpirit willing to undertake the work, and aſſiſted mee graciouſly in it, bleſſed bee his Name.</p>
            <p>And now, Reader, I preſent it to thee; and put it into thy hand as a <hi>Goſpel-Grammar,</hi> to teach thee, not variety of Tongues, but Sanctitie and Excellency of ſpeech. <hi>The Art of ſpeaking well,</hi> that is, the Language of <hi>Canaan</hi> or of a Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtian. Do not only look on this Book by Peruſal, but live it by Practice (to wit, to the Rules deſcribed therein) and it will lead thee towards Perfection in ſome good meaſure on earth; though the full at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainment therof, bee kept as a Reſerve for Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven.</p>
            <p>The Lord accompany this Book with his <hi>Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſence and Power,</hi> that it may bee effectuall to tame that unruly Member thy Tongue, and to make thee <hi>a good Linguiſt in the School of Chriſt;</hi>
               <note place="margin">Pſal. 16.9. with Act. 2.26.</note> then will thy Tongue be <hi>thy glory</hi> indeed.</p>
            <p>To this end I beg a concurrence of thy Prayers with mine, at the Throne of Grace, that God would bleſs it, and make it a bleſſing to all that read it. That the <hi>fruit of it</hi> (like the Trees that grow on the banks of the holy waters, <hi>Ezek. 47.12.</hi>) may bee <hi>for Meat,</hi> to nouriſh heart and lip-Graces in them; and <hi>the Leaves for Medicine,</hi> to heal all their Tongue-vices. No member of the body is ſubject to ſo many <hi>Moral Diſeaſes,</hi> as the Tongue is. It is either the beſt or the worſt mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber of all.</p>
            <p>
               <pb facs="tcp:120106:4"/>
I wait on God to fulfill his promiſes, upon which hee hath cauſed mee to hope,
<note place="margin">Pſal. 119.49.</note> as <hi>the Lord ſhall command the bleſſing upon thee in all that thou ſetteſt thine hand unto.</hi> Deut. <hi>28.8.— he will bleſs all the work of thine hand,</hi> verſ. <hi>12. yee ſhall rejoyce in all that you put your hand unto.</hi> Deut. <hi>12.7.</hi> which imply a generall bleſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing upon all that Gods ſervants do — <hi>whatſoever they do ſhall proſper,</hi> Pſal. <hi>1.3.</hi> Joſh. <hi>1.8</hi>

            <p>The Second Preparative is Reſolution,
<note place="margin">Reſolution.</note> bot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tom'd on Gods grace and ſtrength, for ruling the Tongue. This was <hi>Davids</hi> reſolve in my Text, <hi>I ſaid,</hi> that is, I determined in my ſelf, I will beware and obſerve my waies from of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fending with my Tongue-<hi>I will keep my mouth with a bridle—and I have purpoſed my mouth ſhall not

<note n="q" place="margin">Job 27.3, 4</note> Tongue-tranſgreſſion, to which hee bound himſelf by a double oath; the one in the ſecond ver.—<hi>As God liveth, all the

<note place="margin">Mereer, in Job 27.4.</note> familiar to the Hebrews) what then <hi>Job?</hi> then let mee periſh, or let the Lord puniſh mee ſeverely for it.</p>
            <p>Wiſdome ſhuts the mouth againſt evil, and Reſolution barracado's it. Wiſdome unlocks the lips to good, and Reſolution ſets the doors of the mouth wide open to let it forth.</p>
            <p>A full and fixed purpoſe of heart againſt ſin and vanity will put a bridle into the mouth to reſtrain it from corrupt ſpeech, and idle words; and will looſe the Tongue when it is tied even from good, and caſt out a dumb ſpirit.</p>
            <p>The Tongue is a Bow, words are Arrows; wiſdome ſets them right, Reſolution bends the Bow, and makes them flye. To reſolve well what to ſay, is the way not to ſpeak amiſs. When the heart is not bound up with reſolution to order the mouth aright, the tongue hangs looſe, and is lightly moved to evil.
<note place="margin">Wel ordering of the heart.</note>
            </p>
            <p>The Third Preparative is the well-orde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring, and wel-furniſhing of the heart.</p>
            <p>This is required to the Government of the Tongue, for three Reaſons.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Reaſ.</hi> 1. Becauſe the heart is the guide of the Tongue, that directs it, and dictates to it. The Scribe that indites matter good or bad; the Tongue is the pen of
<note n="r" place="margin">Pſal. 45.1</note> a ready-writer.
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:120106:12"/>A good Scribe makes a good pen. The Heart is the Maſter of the Tongue, and the Tongue is the ſcholar of the heart. <hi>The heart of the wiſe,</hi> ſaith <hi>Solomon,
<note n="ſ" place="margin">Prov. 16.23.</note> teacheth his mouth, and addeth learning to his lips.</hi> A good Maſter makes a good Scholar, ſo a good heart makes a good Tongue. If the Heart go right, the Tongue will follow, and not go wrong. If the Heart bee well framed, the Tongue will be well taught.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Reaſ.</hi> 2. The Heart is the root, fountain and treaſury of the Tongue; it furniſheth the mouth with matter of diſcourſe. The words of the mouth are the fruits, ſtreams, and ſtuff that proceed out of the heart; for out of the a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bundance of the heart (ſaith Chriſt
<note n="t" place="margin">Mat. 12.34.</note>) the mouth ſpeaketh.— A good man out of the good trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure of the Heart bringeth forth good things; and an evil man out of the evil treaſure (<hi>ſcil.</hi> of the heart) bringeth forth evil things—</p>
            <p>As out of the heart proceed
<note n="u" place="margin">Mat. 15.19.</note> evil thoughts, ſo evil words; what are words but motions of the heart, and thoughts of the mind, formed into a voyce or ſound, and made audible?</p>
            <p>Hence ſuch as the Heart is, ſuch is the Tongue; ſuch as the Thoughts and Affections are, ſuch are the words ordinarily.</p>
            <p>For as the Tree is, ſo is the fruit,
<note place="margin">Mat. 7.17, 18. Jam. 3.11.</note> good or bad; As the fountain is, ſuch are the waters, ſweet or bitter. As the treaſure is, ſuch is the ſtuff that is brought out of it, whether pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious or vile. If the Heart be well governed, the Tongue will be well guided (becauſe the Tongue is ruled by the Heart) Be Maſters of your paſſions, and you ſhall eaſily bee Lords
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:120106:13"/>over your Tongues, and govern them well, your Tongues will obey you, when you can command your affections.</p>
            <p>But a diſordered Heart makes an ill orde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red Tongue. They that govern their hearts ill, cannot guide their tongues well. An un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruled ſpirit makes an unruly tongue; they that do not take heed to their ſpirits, what they think, or how they are affected, will not take heed to their Tongues what they ſay. Heart-Renovation is the root of Tongue-Reforma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion; begin at the Heart to amend the Tongue. Pray God, as <hi>David</hi> did
<note n="vv" place="margin">Pſal. 51.10.</note> 
               <hi>to create a clean heart, and renew a right ſpirit in you,</hi> this will make you have a pure lip or language, accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to that promiſe
<note n="x" place="margin">Zeph. 3.9.</note>, for then (that is, under the Goſpell) <hi>I will turn to the people a pure lan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guage</hi> (or lip) <hi>that they may all call upon the name of the Lord, to ſerve him with one ſhoulder.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Reaſ.</hi> 3. Becauſe errors in the tongue pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceed from diſorders in the heart, and from diſtemper in the ſpirit; the diſeaſe is bred in the heart, which breaks out in the mouth, as Idleneſs of words proceeds from vanity of Thoughts; froth in ſpeech, from ſome and fume of ſpirit. Raſhneſs of mouth, from haſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of ſpirit, to be angry: when <hi>Davids</hi> heart was hot within him (with grief and indigna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion) then ſpake hee too impatiently with his tongue
<note n="z" place="margin">Pſal. 30.3.</note>.</p>
            <p>Anger in ſpeech grows from anger in ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit. Bitter words in the mouth ſpring up from a root of bitterneſs in the heart; Falſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hood, fooliſhneſs and guile in the mouth proceeds from folly and deceit in the heart;
<pb n="9" facs="tcp:120106:13"/>a divided heart makes a double tongue. Obſcenity of ſpeech flowes from unclean<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe of heart, Roughneſſe of ſpeech from pride and churliſhneſſe of nature, as in <hi>Rehobo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>am,</hi> 1 King. 12.13. and in <hi>Nabal,</hi> 1 Sam. 25.10, 11.</p>
            <p>Blaſphemy in ſpeech proceeds from back<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſliding and Rebellion in heart againſt God. Deſpairing words come from diſtruſt in heart towards God.</p>
            <p>The ſecond thing is Rules for the Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of the Tongue.</p>
            <p>The firſt Rule.</p>
            <p>Conſider before you ſpeak;
<note place="margin">1 Rule.</note> think what to ſay. Let not your tongue run before your wit; or before wiſdome bid it go, for, <hi>the heart of the Righteous ſtudieth to anſwer,</hi> ſaith <hi>Solo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon</hi>
               <note n="a" place="margin">Prov. 15.28.</note>, hee carrieth a paire of ſcales betwixt his lips (as one ſaith) to weigh his words in, before hee utter them; <hi>but the mouth of the wicked poureth out evilthings,</hi> raſhly and over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flowingly, without preconſideration, or mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deration; a flood of words, without a drop of diſcretion or Religion. The ſtudy of que<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtions, <hi>Paul</hi> calls a doting or a diſeaſe

            <p>
               <hi>He that anſwerech a matter before he hears it,</hi> ſaith the wiſe man,
<note n="c" place="margin">Prov. 18.13.</note> 
               <hi>it is folly and ſhame unto him;</hi> or hee that returneth a word, before he heareth the whole matter, and underſtands it well, ſheweth folly, and procureth ſhame.</p>
            <p>Be not raſh with your mouth, and let not your heart bee haſty to utter any thing before God (no nor before men) It is the Preach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers

<note n="d" place="margin">Eccleſ. 5.2. Prov. 6.2.</note> leſt you diſcover weakneſſe, or be enſnared with the words of your mouth. Suffer not your mouth to cauſe your fleſh (or ſelf) to ſin, by raſh vowes, or extravagant, ſuperfluous words. <hi>Be ſlow to speak,</hi> ſaith <hi>James</hi>
               <note n="e" place="margin">Jam. 1.19.</note>, that is, be deliberate and adviſed in your ſpeeches. For if the heart do not pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meditate, the Tongue will precipitate. The Tongue of the wiſe is in his heart (he conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders what to ſay) the heart of the fool is in his mouth, hee ſpeaks before hee thinks, and ſaith he knows not what. To bee overforward to ſpeak is vain raſhneſs, and proud boldneſs; there is more hope of a fool, than of ſuch, <hi>Pro.</hi> 29.20. when <hi>David</hi> ſpake in his haſte (or precipitation) as that <hi>hee was cut off from be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore Gods eyes</hi>

When Paſſion boils in the heart, it makes the words like hot bur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning coales in the mouth, it dips the tongue in Gall, and imbitters the words. When blind Paſſion leads the blind Tongue, both fall into the Ditch of Tranſgreſſion, and without re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pentance, into the pit of perdition.

There<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore <hi>Licurgus</hi> made few Laws for the Lacede<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monians, becauſe they ſpake little; for they did profeſſe ſilence, and were enemies to much ſpeech.</p>

This Proverb directs us to a Compen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dium of ſpeech, <hi>pro re natâ,</hi> as the matter doth require. A vein of ſpeaking too much, cau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeth ſpeaking amiſſe, and venting of evil; and is commonly attended and tainted with ſelf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>conceit, and vain glory, even in ſpeaking that which is good.

            <p>This is the Preachers Counſel
<note n="n" place="margin">Eccleſ. 5.2.</note>, <hi>Be not raſh with thy mouth, and let not thine heart bee haſty, to utter any word before God</hi> (either in prayer or in vows) <hi>for God is in Heaven, and thou upon earth, therefore let thy words bee few.</hi> Do not over-word it in holy duties, without ſufficient matter, and ſuitable affections. <hi>When yee pray</hi> (ſaith our Saviour
<note n="o" place="margin">Mat. 6.7.</note>) <hi>uſe not vain repetitions;</hi> that is, idle Tautologies, needleſſe and heart<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſſe multiplying of words; for ſo do the Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>then, who think to bee heard for their much ſpeaking. Not that all ingeminations or re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>petitions are unlawfull; for there may be good uſe of them, both in prayer, to expreſs earneſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe of affection, and alſo in preaching, and in conference, to make the people underſtand and remember better, and to cauſe a deeper impreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion in them. But they are idle (as one fitly expreſſeth it) when mens words exceed their matter, or both words and matter ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceed their attention and affection. A man may pray much, yet ſpeak little, if fervent in ſpirit, as did the Publican.</p>
            <p n="2">2 Let not your words be over many to men,
<note place="margin">Prov. 23.2.</note> but rather ſerious and ſhort. Avoid loquacity. As ye ſhould put a knife to your throat, if yee bee given to appetite; ſo put a bridle into your mouth, if yee bee given to much talking. For the babling of the tongue is like the turning of a Ciſtern Cock; and the overflowing of words cauſeth a current of ſin. <hi>Who hath woe? who hath babling? vain frivolous talk? They that tar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry long at the wine,</hi> ſaith the wiſe man

            <p>
               <hi>Reaſ.</hi> 3 Becauſe an open mouth bewrayeth an empty, frothy heart, as an open Veſſel ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gues the commonneſſe of the liquor that is in it. When a Cheſt ſtands wide open, we con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clude there is no ſilver nor gold in it. Wee keep our Coffers lockt, wherein wee lay up our Rings, Jewels, and precious things; wee keep the mouths of pots and glaſſes (that have ſweet or ſtrong waters in them) cloſe ſtopt, leſt the giving of them full vent, ſhould let out, or diminiſh the vertue of them. When the heart hath a good Treaſure in it, the mouth is kept under lock and key; and will not la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viſh out words prodigally, to no purpoſe; but lay them out frugally to the profit of others. When the Tongue ſpeaks without ſtint or re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtraint <hi>(quicquid in buccam venerit)</hi> the heart is common, vain and vile.</p>
            <p>The third Grace f the lips is Meekneſs and Humility,
<note n="3" place="margin">Meekneſs.</note>
               <note place="margin">1 Pet. 3.15.</note> without pride, Oſtentation or harſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe. <hi>Bee ready,</hi> ſaith <hi>Peter, to give an anſwer to every man,
<note place="margin">Tit. 3.1, 2.</note> &amp;c. with meekneſs and fear. Put them in mind</hi> (ſaith <hi>Paul</hi> to <hi>Titus) toſpeak evil of no man, to bee no Brawlers but gentle, ſhewing all meekneſſe unto all men;</hi> to wit, in word, as well as in deed. Meek and kind language purchaſeth good Will, and a good Name.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Reaſ.</hi> 1 Becauſe Meekneſſe makes both the Tongue and the words ſoft; dips them both in oyl.</p>
            <p n="1">1 The Tongue; <hi>and a ſoft Tongue breaketh the bone</hi>
               <note n="q" place="margin">Prov. 25.15.</note>, that is, peirceth and convinceth, perſwadeth and overcometh an angry, im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>placable
<pb n="37" facs="tcp:120106:27"/>heart; a ſtout, ſtern ſpirit, which elſe would not buckle.</p>
            <p n="2">2 The Words; <hi>and a ſoft anſwer turns away wrath</hi>
               <note n="r" place="margin">Prov. 15.1.</note>. As <hi>Abigails</hi> milde and meek anſwer diverted <hi>Davids</hi> rage and reſolution to kil <hi>Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bal. Gideons</hi> gentle ſpeech allayed the ſharp chiding of the Ephraimites
<note n="ſ" place="margin">Judg 8.1, 2, 3.</note>,— <hi>Then their anger was abated towards him, when he had ſaid that.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Hard to hard (as the ſaying is) will never do. Hard ſpeeches cannot break or mollifie hard hearts. <hi>Grievous words ſtir up anger;</hi> they adde oyl to the flame. Soft words caſt water upon it to quench it. <hi>Be curteous,</hi> or affable, ſaith <hi>Peter
<note n="t" place="margin">1 Pet. 3.8, 9.</note>, not rendring evil for evil, or rai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling for railing; but contrariwiſe, bleſſing.</hi> Its water, not fire, that can put out fire, nor dirt, that can waſh off dirt. Soft words and hard arguments (proceeding from meekneſs of wiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome) do convince and perſwade power<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Reaſ.</hi> 2 Becauſe pride in the mouth is a rod to ſtrike others; wherewith the fool layeth a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout him like a mad man;
<note n="u" place="margin">Prov: 14.3.</note> 
               <hi>In the mouth of the fooliſh is a rod of pride,</hi> ſaith the wiſe man. Such at length ſhall bee beaten with their own rod; for their own Tongue ſhall fall upon them. <hi>A fools lips enter into contention

               <note n="x" place="margin">Pſal. 12.3.</note>.</p>
            <p>Though the Tongue bee but <hi>a little mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber,</hi> yet it <hi>boaſteth great things,</hi> ſaith <hi>James</hi>
               <note n="y" place="margin">Jam. 3.5.</note>. Boaſting is the uſual ſin of the Tongue; and the Tongue is ordinarily the Servant of pride. Therefore <hi>Hannah</hi> ſaid to her adverſary, who

            <p>
               <hi>Reaſ.</hi> 3 Roughneſſe or harſhneſſe of ſpeech is an uncomlineſſe, ill beſeeming the mouth, either of a great or good man. <hi>Nabals</hi> chur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſh anſwer to <hi>Davids</hi> Servants had like to have coſt him his life.

            <p>Harſh, uneven ſpeech proceeds from a rough, unhewn ſpirit. Let the rich take heed they do not anſwer the poor roughly, when hee uſeth intreaties
<note n="b" place="margin">Prov. 18.23.</note>. To affect Maſterfull<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of ſpeech, or ſpeaking in an imperious, commanding way, is to be a ſervant to pride and paſſion.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Reaſ.</hi> 4 Becauſe meekneſs was the grace of Chriſts lips. <hi>For hee did not ſtrive, nor cry, nor did any man hear his voice in the ſtreets
<note n="c" place="margin">Mat. 12.19.</note>, viz.</hi> in way of Contention, Ambition, Oſtentation, Perturbation, or Clamour; but hee ever ſpake meekly and mildly; yea, even to his enemies; to <hi>Judas</hi> that betrayed him; to his apprehen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders, accuſers, condemners, and crucifiers.

            <p>The grace of meekneſs was poured into his lips; his mouth was ever full of it. And he hath left us an example of meekneſs in ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit and in ſpeech, that wee ſhould follow his ſteps,
<note place="margin">Mat. 11.29.</note> and learn it of him.</p>
            <p>Meek ſpeech is the Lambs blea, but bitter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs and clamour is the Lions roar. With meekneſſe joyn Courteſie and kindneſſe, which is an ornament to the lips. In the vertuous

            </p>
            <p>The Tongue annointed with the vertue of kindneſſe and courteſy, will cure diſtempers in others, and draw kindneſſe from them.</p>
            <p>A Mouth full of kindneſſe is like a Combe full of honey, then the lips are like <hi>Lillies dropping ſweet-ſmelling myrrhe.</hi>

            <p n="1">I. The ſeaſons of ſilence.</p>
            <p n="1">1 When wee are afflicted by God. This is Silence from murmuring. When <hi>Nadab</hi> and <hi>Abihu</hi> were burnt by fire from the Lord, <hi>then Aaron</hi> their Father <hi>held his peace,</hi> Lev. 10.3. <hi>I was dumb,</hi>

<note n="e" place="margin">Lam. 3.27, 28</note>. God puts us to ſilence when hee gives us the waters of gall to
<note n="f" place="margin">Jer. 8.14.</note> drink.</p>
            <p n="2">2. When wee are injured by men. This is
<pb n="48" facs="tcp:120106:33"/>ſilence from reviling or revenge. Its proba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble <hi>Moſes</hi> held his peace,
<note place="margin">Numb. 12.1. to 10</note> and put up the wrong when <hi>Aaron</hi> and <hi>Miriam</hi> ſpake againſt him: therefore the Lord ſpake for him, and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proved them. When <hi>Davids</hi> enemies ſpake miſchievous things againſt him, &amp;c. <hi>But I,</hi> ſaith he, <hi>as a deaf man heard not, I was as a dumb man that openeth not his mouth</hi>
               <note n="g" place="margin">Pſal. 38.12, 13, 14.</note>. Our Savi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>our <hi>was brought as a Lamb to the ſlaughter, and as a ſheep before the Shearers is dumb, ſo hee opened not his mouth
<note n="h" place="margin">Iſa. 53.7</note>;—when hee was reviled hee reviled not again
<note n="i" place="margin">1 Pet. 2.23</note>. Anſwer not a Fool ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to his Folly,</hi> ſaith the wiſeman
<note n="k" place="margin">Prov. 26.4</note>, that is, do not rage, revile, or ſpeak idlely as he doth, leſt thou bee like or equal unto him. For the anſwer a man giveth another, is the picture or meaſure of himſelf. A fooliſh an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwer ſheweth a fooliſh man. The beſt anſwer to a fool in ſuch a caſe is ſilence.</p>
            <p n="3">3 When the times are perilous and men <hi>watch for iniquity,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Iſa. 29.20, 21</note> and <hi>make a man an offender for a word, and lay a ſnare for him that repro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veth in the Gate;</hi> that is, in publick; both for Magiſtrate and Miniſter, to bring them into trouble for their ſlips and failings in ſpeech; or by wreſting and miſconſtruing their words, When what we ſpeak is like to prove a ſnare to us. This ſilence is forbearance to ſpeak, at leaſt, out or broad, except we be called there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>The prudent ſhall keep ſilence in that time,
<note place="margin">Amos. 5.12, 13.</note> for it is an evil time.</hi> Then hee that keeps his Tongue keeps his life. <hi>Micah's</hi> counſell

            <p>When others watch for our words to pick out of them matter againſt us, or ask us temp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting, enſnaring queſtions, ſilence may bee in ſeaſon for us. In this caſe our Saviour was ſometimes ſilent, and gave no anſwer; as, when hee was accuſed before the High-Prieſt and <hi>Pilate,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Mar. 15.3, 4, 5. &amp; 14.60.61.</note> and they earneſtly provoked him to ſpeak for himſelf, yet he would ſay nothing, which made them wonder.</p>
            <p n="4">4 When the wicked are before us, who will ſcoffe, and ſcorn, and reject what we ſay? and wee have no hope of doing them good thereby, but fear they will bee worſe. This ſilence is a forbearance to inſtruct, reprove, or relate our condition before ſuch. <hi>I will keep my mouth as with a bridle,</hi> ſaith <hi>David
<note n="l" place="margin">Pſal. 39.1.</note>, while the wicked is before mee;</hi> that is, I will be ſilent, and not ſpeak of my calamity before them, leſt they rejoyce at it, and reproach mee for it.</p>
            <p>To reprove and admoniſh obſtinate ſinners, who will prophane, but never profit by holy things, is to caſt pearles before ſwine, who will trample them under their feet, and turn again and rend you; and to caſt holy things to Dogs, who will knarle at them, and bark and bite you for them.
<note place="margin">2 King. 18.36.</note> King <hi>Heze<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kiah</hi> commanded his people to be ſilent, and not to anſwer a word to <hi>Rabſhekah's</hi> flatteries,

<note n="n" place="margin">Prov. 23.9.</note>, This is to offer light to the blind, or ſpeech to the deaf. <hi>Ephra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>im is joyned to Idols,</hi> ſaith God, <hi>let him alone</hi>

            <p n="5">5 When wee are angry, and our ſpirits are diſtempered. Paſſion is no ſeaſon for ſpeech, as appears in <hi>Moſes, Jonah</hi> and others. Paſſion as one ſaith is a bad counſellor, and as ill a ſpeaker. Oh! that we were ſo much Maſters over our Tongues, as not to ſpeak when wee are angry.

<note n="q" place="margin">Joh. 16.12.</note>.</p>
            <p n="6">6 When thoſe ſpeak, who are above us in age, gifts, grace, or authority. <hi>Unto mee men gave ear</hi> (ſaith <hi>Job</hi>) <hi>and waited,

            <p>There is wiſdome in keeping ſilence as in ſpeaking. <hi>Hee that refraineth his lips is wiſe,</hi> ſaith <hi>Solomon</hi>
               <note n="x" place="margin">Prov. 10.19</note>;—and, <hi>A fool uttereth all his mind, but a wiſe man keepeth it in till after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards</hi>

            <p n="2">2 Now follow the ſeaſons of Speech;
<note place="margin">The ſeaſons of Speech.</note> when its time to ſpeak, I will name four.</p>
            <p>Firſt, when we are called to ſpeak by God or man, 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 3.15. when wee are ſtirred up in our ſpirits to ſpeak, provided we keep with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in the compaſſe of our Callings therein, and do not ſtretch our ſelves beyond our line, let private perſons take heed how they under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>take to ſpeak publikely; or uſurpe the place of Magiſtrate or Miniſter. They may queſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on whence ſuch a motion proceeds, whether from Pride, paſſion, Envy, Bitter Zeal, or a miſ-guided ſpirit, rather than from the good Spirit of God, who is the God of Order, not of Confuſion; what men ſpeak out of their place is ſpoken out of ſeaſon.</p>

<note place="margin">Eph. 6.19.</note>

            </p>
            <p>Third Seaſon; When an opportunity is gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven of ſpeaking for the glory of God, or for the good of Men.</p>
            <p n="1">1 For the Glory of God, as to defend his truth, plead his cauſe, advance righteouſneſs, and to diſgrace, and ſuppreſſe ſinne; to own God in the particular diſpenſations of his pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vidence, and to give him the praiſe of them, whether mercies or judgements.

            <p n="1">1 Who cannot ſpeak for themſelves,

               <hi>open thy mouth for the dumb.</hi>

            <p>Fourth Seaſon of Speech is, when the per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons to bee ſpoken too, are attentive, wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling to hear, and in a readineſſe or capacity to receive our words, as the people did <hi>Jobs;
<note place="margin">Job 29.23</note> They waited for mee</hi> (to hear mee ſpeak) <hi>and they opened their mouth wide</hi> (<hi>i. e.</hi> gaped for my words) <hi>as for the latter rain. Jobs</hi> ſpeech was then in ſeaſon. When they, to whom wee ſpeak, ſeem to have an obedient ear, to take in that Counſel, comfort or reproof wee give forth to them, and to bee wrought upon thereby, and appear to bee as mettal melted,
<pb n="56" facs="tcp:120106:37"/>fit to bee new moulded; as iron heated, fit to bee hammered; as hungry, empty bellies, fit to bee fild and fed. In this poſture Chriſt found the Woman of <hi>Samaria,</hi>

            <p>Our Speech ſhould bee in ſeaſon for three Reaſons.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Reaſ.</hi> 1. There is beauty and ſweetneſſe therein.
<note place="margin">Ecel. 3.11</note> For <hi>God hath made every thing beau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tifull in his time,</hi> that is, in the ſeaſon God appointed to it, every word, as well as every work. Silence in its ſeaſon, and ſpeech in its ſeaſon. Such are words of <hi>Delight,</hi> which the Preacher ſought to find out
<note n="d" place="margin">Eccl. 12.10</note>.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>A word fitly ſpoken</hi> (ſaith <hi>Solomon</hi>) that is, for time, as well as for place, or perſons, <hi>is like apples of gold in pictures of ſilver.</hi> Some think, it was a kind of ornament uſed in thoſe dayes; or, that golden Apples were ſet in ſilver Caſes or Diſhes, ſo as the one did grace and let out the other. Gold and Silver are precious mettals. Apples and pictures are pleaſant to the eye, lovely to look upon. Apples are alſo ſweet to the mouth. Words are the pictures of the mind, drawn with the pencil of the Tongue; and the apples of the mouth are the fruits of the lips. Good words ſpoken in ſeaſon are precious and pleaſant, ſweet and amiable; gold for their worth, framed (as one hath it) to ſilver-like opportu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nities. Herewith the Spouſe craves to bee comforted,
<note place="margin">Cant. 2.5</note> 
               <hi>Comfort mee with Apples;</hi> for the ſavour of theſe apples, (that is, of good ſeaſonable words) greatly refreſh Languiſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing fouls that are ſick of love to Chriſt. Chriſt
<pb n="57" facs="tcp:120106:37"/>commends the ſmell of the Churches Noſe (or mouth) her ſweet breath to be like apples for their redolency &amp; fragrancy in the ſeaſon of them.
<note place="margin">Cant. 7.</note> Apples have a delightfull breath or ſmell. Words inſeaſon are like the apples of <hi>Eden,</hi> that grow upon the Tree of Life, for, a <hi>wholeſome Tongue is a Tree of Life;</hi>
               <note place="margin">Prov. 15.4</note> and the fruit of the righteous is a Tree of Life
<note n="e" place="margin">Prov. 11.30</note>; and ſeaſonable words are a part of that fruit. They are like flowers in the Spring, freſh and fair in their colours, (exceeding <hi>Solomon</hi> in his Glory) ſweet and pleaſant in their Smell. Words ſpoken out of ſeaſon are like withe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red flowers, without colour and ſmell. To keep Time in Muſick, makes it melodious; to ſtrike and ſtop every ſtring, and ſing every note in due ſeaſon. So words ſpoken in ſea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon are Muſick and melodie in the ears of thoſe that hear them.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Reaſ.</hi> 2. There is efficacy and acceptable<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe therein.
<note place="margin">Prov. 15.23</note> 
               <hi>A word ſpoken in due ſeaſon how good is it?</hi> how profitable and effectuall? how welcome and acceptable? even as rain in ſeaſon, how doth it refreſh the earth, and make it fruitfull? Its as meat in ſeaſon, which nouriſheth and ſatisfieth all living Creatures
<note n="f" place="margin">Pſ. 145.15, 16</note>; as fruit in due ſeaſon, (which God hath promiſed the righteous ſhall bring forth <hi>Pſa.</hi> 1.3.) fully ripe, ſavoury and wholeſome, yea, as a Coach upon the wheeles, for the words runne thus in the Original, <hi>A word ſpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken upon his wheels</hi>
               <note n="g" place="margin">Prov. 25.11</note>; it moves eaſily and ſwift<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, goeth ſmoothly and roundly away like a Triumphant Chariot; being oiled with the fitneſſe of the ſeaſon, wherein it is ſpoken,
<pb n="58" facs="tcp:120106:38"/>
               <hi>Abigals</hi> ſpeech to <hi>David,</hi> and the wiſe wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man of <hi>Abel's</hi> ſpeech to <hi>Joab,</hi> how good were they, being ſpoken upon the wheeles, to ſave <hi>Nabals</hi> life, and the City of <hi>Abel?</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="1">1 Words ſpoken out of ſeaſon, are like a Cart without wheeles, or like <hi>Pharaohs</hi> Chariots, when the wheels were taken off; which made them go heavily; They are un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>comely and uncommodious, as ſnow in ſum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer, and as rain in harveſt, which doth hurt. The ſame words ſpoken at one time (<hi>ſcil.</hi> in ſeaſon) would bee butter and honey, yea kiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes, which ſpoken at another time (<hi>viz.</hi> out of ſeaſon) may prove wormwood and gall, yea ſtabs.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Reaſ.</hi> 3. There is art and expertneſs there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in. It requires great wiſdome and skill to circumſtantiate words well, or to fit them to time and place, &amp;c. to diſcern the opportu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity of a ſpeech.</p>
            <p>It is a parcell of Tongue-skill or learning, to time a word well, as to time notes and ſtroaks in Muſick.
<note place="margin">Iſa. 50.4.</note> 
               <hi>God hath given mee,</hi> (ſaith the Prophet <hi>Iſaiah,</hi> and to Chriſt much more) <hi>the Tongue of the learned</hi> (that is, a well-skild Tongue) <hi>that I ſhould know how to ſpeak a word in ſeaſon,</hi> or (how to time or ſeaſon a word) <hi>to him that is weary.</hi> If wee ſpeak not when wee ought, then ſilence is our folly. Opportunity is the quinteſſence of time, for ſpeaking, as well as for acting.</p>
            <p>Fifthly and Laſtly, Have reſpect to the End why you ſpeak;
<note place="margin">The end of Speech.</note> let that bee pure and ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cere, to wit,
<list>
                  <item>Gods glory.</item>
                  <item>Others good.</item>
               </list>

            <p>
               <pb n="59" facs="tcp:120106:38"/>
As the Occaſions that have in them a ten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dency hereunto are an opportunity of Speech; So a fixed intention or aim at theſe two, is the right end of Speech.</p>
            <p n="1">1 Gods glory, whether yee eat or drink, or whatſoever you do, ſaith <hi>Paul</hi>—So,
<note place="margin">1 Cor. 10.31.</note> whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther yee keep ſilence or ſpeak, or whatſoever yee ſay, ſay all to the glory of God. To this end, account your Tongues your glory, as <hi>Da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vid;</hi> not to trumpet your own excellencies or praiſes, but to declare the Majeſty, and glory, and honour of God.</p>
            <p n="2">2 Others good, for their inſtruction, Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehenſion, Conſolation, Direction, Confir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mation, Reduction, Reſolution, Vindicati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on Satisfaction.</p>
            <p>Keep theſe, as the mark in your eye to take aim at, in what yee ſpeak, as to man, accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to the Apoſtles Rule, which ſhould bee followed both in the intention and execution of our Speech.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Let no corrupt communication proceed out of your mouth,
<note place="margin">Epheſ. 4.29.</note> but that which is good to the uſe of edifying, that it may miniſter grace to the Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rers.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Let your ends in ſpeaking ever bee to bring glory to God, and to do good to others.</p>
            <p>The Tongue is an uſefull inſtrument,</p>
            <p n="1">1 For Healing, <hi>Prov.</hi> 12.18—the tongue of the wiſe is health. <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap> Signifieth a me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicine or healing. So it is rendred in <hi>Prov.</hi> 4.22. A wiſe godly man hath an Apothecaries ſhop in his mouth, and healing Medicines therein, of all ſorts; for the cure of all kinds of
<pb n="60" facs="tcp:120106:39"/>diſtempers and diſeaſes in the Spirits, ſpeech<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>es, and carriage of others; And the time of ſpeaking is a time of healing, like Spring, and Fall, to give phyſick in. A holy Tongue hath a healing property to lick the ſores of others whole; It hath in it the Balm of <hi>Gilead</hi> to heal wounds; and the Oyl of gladneſs, to eaſe pains. A wholeſome Tongue (or the healing of the tongue) is a Tree of life,
<note place="margin">Prov. 15.4.</note> ſaith <hi>Solomon,</hi> it cureth blindneſſe, by inſtruction; Corruption by Reprehenſion; and Sadneſſe, by Conſola<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion; Hardneſs, by Lenitive; and deadneſſe, by Corraſive arguments. A charitable Tongue is medicinable to lick others whole, who have been laſhed ſore with Scorpion Tongues.</p>
            <p n="2">2 For Feeding — <hi>The lips of the Righteous feed many,</hi> ſaith <hi>Solomon</hi>
               <note n="b" place="margin">Prov. 10.21.</note>; Chriſtians ſhould have meat in their mouths to feed others (with wholeſome counſel, comfort, and the like) as Doves do one <hi>another, Thy lips, O my Spouſe, drop as the hony-comb,</hi> ſaith Chriſt
<note n="c" place="margin">Cant. 4.11.</note>, <hi>hony and milk are under thy Tongue.</hi> Theſe two were the bleſſings of <hi>Canaan,</hi> and are the fruits of a godly mans mouth, to feed others with, both for nouriſhment and delight. His lips are full of Hoſpitality, or a free Table fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhed with the dainties of heavenly, grace-miniſtring, Soul-nouriſhing words. A godly man hath a Dole of grace at the door of his mouth as well as of Alms at the door of his houſe. Its bad and ſad beyond expreſſion to abuſe the Tongue, or not to uſe it to good ends and purpoſes. To propound a good end in all wee ſpeak, is a means to order our words
<pb n="61" facs="tcp:120106:39"/>aright, to attain the ſame, and to put our Tongues alwayes to good uſe: As, to conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der the end of our actions, is the way not to do amiſs.</p>
            <p>The Third Rule.</p>
            <p>Commit your Tongues (as well as your heads or hearts) into Gods hands,
<note n="3" place="margin">Rule.</note> to guide them aright, and to keep them from evil.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Reaſ.</hi> Becauſe God is the Tongues maker (as hee ſaid to <hi>Moſes
<note n="f" place="margin">Exod. 4.11.</note> who hath made mans mouth? or who maketh the dumb, or deaf, &amp;c? have not I the Lord?</hi>) and the Tongues Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſter, to, 1 Command it. 2 Guide it. 3 Keep it. 4 Purge it. 5 Proſper it.</p>
            <p n="1">1 God is Lord over the Tongue to com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand it, to ſpeak or to keep ſilence. His Law binds our Tongues (as well as our hands) to obedience; and wee muſt yeeld ſubjection to God in the one as well as in the other. Our lips are not our own, to uſe as wee liſt,
<note place="margin">Pſal. 12.4.</note> but they are Gods who is Lord over us. God keeps the key of mans mouth, and his hand openeth and ſhutteth it at his pleaſure, as he did <hi>Eze<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kiels</hi> mouth, <hi>cap.</hi> 3 26, 27. and <hi>cap.</hi> 33.22. and <hi>Daniels</hi> mouth, <hi>cap.</hi> 10, 15, 16.
<note place="margin">Luk. 1.20.</note> Thus God ſhut <hi>Zacharias</hi> his mouth for his unbe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leef, and opened it again, <hi>verſ.</hi> 64.</p>
            <p>If God open the mouth none can ſhut it, as hee did the mouths of his Prophets; Nations and kingdomes could not ſtop them, and of Chriſts Apoſtles, neither Impriſonment, nor the Councils command of ſilence, could make them hold their peace; <hi>wee cannot but ſpeak</hi> (ſaid <hi>Peter</hi> and <hi>John</hi>) <hi>the things which wee have ſeen and heard</hi>

            <p>
               <pb n="62" facs="tcp:120106:40"/>
And if hee ſhut it, none can open it; <hi>Ezeki<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>el, Daniel, Zacharias</hi> were all dumb, till God pleaſed to open their mouths. God can open and ſhut the mouths of Beaſts at his pleaſure. The Lord opened the mouth of the Aſs to reprove her maſter <hi>Balaam
<note n="h" place="margin">Numb. 22.28, 30. 2 Pet. 2.16.</note>. The dumb Aſs ſpoke with mans voice</hi> — God ſhut the Dogs mouths in <hi>Egypt,</hi> to one moved his Tongue againſt any of the Children of <hi>iſrael,</hi> againſt man or beaſt
<note n="i" place="margin">Exod. 11.7. Din. 6.22.</note>. God ſhut the Lions mouths that they ſhould not hurt <hi>Daniel.</hi> God can put a muzzle on mens mouths, and tye up or reſtrain their Tongues when hee pleaſeth, as hee did <hi>Labans</hi> from ſpeaking to <hi>Jacob,</hi> either good or bad
<note n="k" place="margin">Gen. 31.24.</note>; and the Canaanites, none (of them) moved his Tongue againſt any of the Children of <hi>Iſrael</hi>
               <note n="l" place="margin">Joſh. 10.21.</note>.</p>
            <p>God can heal all Tongue-infirmities, and impediments of ſpeech, as Chriſt opened the ears, and looſed the Tongue of him that was deaf, and had an impediment in his ſpeech; and hee ſpake plain
<note n="m" place="margin">Mar. 7.33, 34, 35. Iſa. 35.6. &amp; 32.4.</note>.</p>
            <p>God can make the Tongue of the dumb to ſing, and the Tongue of the Stammerers rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy to ſpeak plainly, or elegantly. Pray the Lord to keep the key of your mouthes ever in his own hand; to open them when hee would have you to ſpeak, and to ſhut them when he would have you to keep ſilence. Pray with <hi>David
<note n="n" place="margin">Pſal. 51.15.</note>, O Lord open thou my lips, and my mouth ſhall ſhew forth thy praiſe,</hi> to wit, upon all occaſions — and heal, Lord, what is amiſs in my mouth.</p>
            <p n="2">2 God is Lord over the Tongue, to guide it what to ſpeak, and how and when. That
<pb n="63" facs="tcp:120106:40"/>was a ſweet and gracious promiſe of God to <hi>Moſes,</hi> when <hi>Moſes</hi> made excuſes to wave the ſervice of God impoſed on him, <hi>Exod.</hi> 4.10. <hi>O my Lord, I am not eloquent</hi> (or a man of words) <hi>but I am ſlow of ſpeech and of a ſlow Tongue</hi>—God ſaid unto him, <hi>Now therefore go, and I will bee thy mouth, and teach thee what thou ſhalt ſay.</hi>—Verſ. 12. God can put what words hee will into mens mouths, and make them ſpeak, not what they will but what he pleaſeth; and ſome time contrary to what they intend.</p>
            <p>Thus God made <hi>Balaam</hi> to bleſſe <hi>Iſrael,</hi> when hee came to curſe them, and he could do no other, as hee told

               <hi>every one did that which was right in his own eyes;</hi> So when the Tongue hath no overſeer, or guide, it ſpeaks what it liſts, it multiplyeth ſinne, as faſt as words, yea, ſometimes faſter, wrap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ping up two, or more ſinnes in one word; you heard before, in the multitude of words there wants no ſinne.

            <p n="1">1 His moſt ſinnes, becauſe the Tongue formeth and increaſeth iniquity more than a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny other member of the body.</p>

There is a grave in the throat (to bury others in quick) guile in the Tongue, poyſon in the Lips, gall (or bitterneſſe) in the mouth.—The ſinnes of the Tongue have an univerſal influ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence, not onely upon all the members of the body (as was ſhewed before) to pervert, pol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lute, yea poyſon them all, but over all cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lings, conditions, relations, in which a man ſtands.

<pb n="91" facs="tcp:120106:54"/>men, and women.—</p>
            <p>The ſins of the mouth leave both a ſtain, and a ſting in the ſoul. Therefore <hi>perverſeneſs in the Tongue is a breach in the ſpirit,</hi> ſaith

               <hi>Solomon.</hi>— Is it needfull for us to keep our mouthes from evil? ſo is it to guide our Tongues well; Both are equally neceſſary, the one as the end, the other as the means.

            <p>Thirdly and laſtly, the miſchief of the tongue appears by the final miſery it draws others into, that is Hell, and drowns them in eternal deſtruction.

            <p>For the Tongue is either the beſt or worſt member of the body, as it is ordered; and an inſtrument of great good, or of great hurt; When it is well ordered, it is an inſtrument of great good,</p>
            <p n="1">1 To our ſelves, to procure us four things, <hi>ſcil.</hi> life, ſalvation, joy, and ſatisfaction.</p>
            <p n="1">1 Life, for God hath intaild the promiſe of living long, and ſeeing good dayes upon the refrayning of the Tongue from evil,
<note place="margin">1 Per. 3.10.</note> and of the lips from guile. <hi>Death and Life are in the power of the Tongue</hi> (ſaith <hi>Solomon</hi>) <hi>and they that love it ſhall eat the fruits thereof</hi> — in the power, that is,
<note place="margin">Prov. 18.21.</note> in the government of the Tongue.</p>
            <p n="1">1 To ſave and prolong life, if it be well go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verned.</p>
            <p n="2">2 To condemn, and ſhorten life, if it be ill guided.</p>
            <p>For though the tongue be but a little mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber, yet it hath a great command, what a great dependance is there upon a mans own tongue, for life or death; as there is upon the Judges tongue, for paſſing ſentence upon the
<pb n="108" facs="tcp:120106:63"/>priſoners, of abſolution or condemnation.</p>
            <p>They that love life will uſe their tongues well, and they ſhall eat the pleaſant fruits of it. They that love death, let their tongues run at randome, have not maſtery over them, and they ſhall eat the bitter fruits thereof. As e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very one delights to uſe his tongue (well or ill) or as he ſoweth his words, ſo he ſhall reap fruit, good or bad.</p>
            <p n="2">2 Salvation; for as with <hi>the heart man be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leeveth unto righteouſneſs</hi> (or Juſtification) So <hi>with the mouth confeſſion is made unto

            </p>
            <p>The well uſing or abuſing of the Tongue is effectuall, either for ſalvation or deſtructi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, to eternity.</p>
            <p>As life and death, ſo Heaven and Hell, Sal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation and damnation are in the power of the Tongue, <hi>ſcil.</hi> thus far, that according as men rule their tongues well or ill, ſo they ſhall bee ſaved or damned; go to Heaven or Hell. Hence it is that <hi>David</hi> deſcribes a Citizen of <hi>Zion</hi> more largely by his
<note n="g" place="margin">Pſa. 15.1, 2, 3.</note> tongue, as <hi>that hee ſpeaketh the truth in his heart, he backbiteth not with his tongue, nor — doth</hi> (any) <hi>evil</hi> (thereby) <hi>to his neighbour — he ſweareth to his own hurt, and changeth not,</hi> verſ. 4. than by any other member of his body, either foot, verſ. 2. <hi>that hee walketh uprightly,</hi> or hand, <hi>that he worketh righteouſneſs,</hi> or ears, <hi>that he doth not receive a reproach againſt his Neighbour,</hi> verſ. 3. or eyes, <hi>that a vile perſon is contemned therein,</hi> verſe 4.</p>
            <p>Tongue-properties and praiſes are tripple, if not quadruple, and the commendation of
<pb n="109" facs="tcp:120106:63"/>the other members but ſingle.</p>
            <p n="3">3 Joy, for <hi>a man hath joy by the anſwer of his
<note n="h" place="margin">Prov. 15.23.</note> mouth,</hi> when he hath ſpoken right words, ſuitable, ſeaſonable and effectuall (as was de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clared before.) The wiſdome of a mans ſpeech is the rejoycing of his heart. This is our re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joycing (ſaith <hi>Paul</hi>) the teſtimony of our conſcience within; I may adde;
<note place="margin">2 Cor. 1.12.</note> the innocency of our Tongues, and the purity of our lips without.</p>
            <p n="4">4 Satisfaction, <hi>A man ſhall be ſatisfied with good by the fruit of his mouth,</hi> ſaith the
<note n="i" place="margin">Prov. 12.14.</note> Wiſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man — ſhall eat good by it, — <hi>cap.</hi> 13.2. — <hi>A mans belly ſhall bee ſatisfied with the fruit of his mouth, and with the increaſe of his lips ſhall he bee filled,</hi> Prov. 18.20. and <hi>verſ.</hi> 21. — he ſhall eat the fruit, <hi>ſcil.</hi> of the tongue. This ſatisfaction is contentfull acquieſcence, and comfortable compoſure of mind and heart, upon a fourfold account.</p>
            <p n="1">1 That God hath been with our mouthes and directed our tongues what to ſay.</p>
            <p n="2">2 That God will reward as well the words of our mouthes, as the works of our hands; yea all the inſtruments of ſpeech ſhall have their proper and full reward, as the — tongue, mouth, lips; which ſome conceive the cauſe, why <hi>Solomon</hi> ſo particularly, and diſtinctly names them. The good uſage of the tongue to the glory of God, and good of others, the Lord God of Recompences will ſurely re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quite both here and hereafter.</p>
            <p n="3">3 That we ſhall reap good to our ſelves by ſpeaking of that which is good to others; by inſtructing, exhorting, counſelling and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forting
<pb n="110" facs="tcp:120106:64"/>others, we teach, excite, adviſe and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>freſh our ſelves, and may thereby grow better both in knowledge and in practice.</p>
            <p>By ſpeaking of good things to others, wee imprint the ſame more deeply upon our own hearts, and our knowledge is made more clear, and our affections more warm. Where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>as the ſpeaking of evil words make men worſe; they corrupt their own good manners.</p>
            <p n="4">4 That wee may expect to receive good from others in way of recompence, for the fruit of our mouthes, and increaſe of our lips, beſtowed upon them, in wholeſome inſtru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctions, counſels and conſolations, as <hi>Paul</hi> writ to the
<note n="k" place="margin">1 Cor. 9.11</note> 
               <hi>Corinthians.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>If we ſow unto you ſpiritual things,</hi> (<hi>ſcil.</hi> by our mouthes) <hi>is it a great thing if wee ſhall reap your carnal things?</hi> (ſcil. with our hands) the mouth is a field narrow in compaſſe, but fruitfull above meaſure (either with good or evil, with wholeſome or hurtful words) there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore <hi>Solomon</hi> ſpeaketh often of the fruit of the mouth. It is very commodious to ſow this field with good ſeed, and it will yeeld you your own with great advantage.</p>
            <p>Ought wee not to govern our tongues well, as wee deſire to injoy life or ſalvation, joy or ſatisfaction?</p>
            <p n="2">2 Great is the commodity of a well orde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red tongue, in reſpect of others, the benefits and advantages, that redound to them there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by (as we ſhewed before in the ſecond Rule for regulating ſpeech, in the end thereof. E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpecially theſe three)</p>
            <p n="1">1 Communication of our minds, gifts, gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces,
<pb n="111" facs="tcp:120106:64"/>and experiences to others, were it not for the tongue, one man ſhould not know the mind of another, but bee as a veſſel without vent, ſtopt up, a ſpring hidden in the ground, or a fountain ſealed; words are the image, and the tongue the Index of the mind;
<note place="margin">Pſal. 66.16.</note> wee could not tell others what God hath done for our ſouls, nor counſel others what they ſhould in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treat God to do for their ſouls; nor provoke others to love, or to do good works, if we wan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted either the precious faculty of ſpeech; or the gracious government of the tongue, <hi>The lips of the wiſe diſperſe knowledge</hi> ſaith
<note n="l" place="margin">Prov. 15.7.</note> 
               <hi>Solomon,</hi> how? as the Sun doth beams of light, and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fluences; as a fountain doth water; fire doth heat, and flowers do fragrant ſmell; — and as they deſperſe knowledge, ſo other gifts; a ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritual bleſſing for all to gather up, and ſuck in, who are ſo wiſe as to know the worth thereof.</p>
            <p n="2">2 Is Salvation, both</p>
            <p n="1">1 Temporal, our tongues may ſometimes ſave others ſooner than our hands — <hi>Abigail</hi> by her tongue ſaved <hi>Nabals</hi> life, and the wiſe woman of <hi>Abel</hi> by her tongue preſerved the City, as I ſhewed before. 2 And eternall, No member of the body can help others to Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven ſo effectually and ſpeedily as the tongue. God uſeth and bleſſeth the ſame as an inſtru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of the converſion, inſtruction, edificati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, reformation and confirmation of thoſe that ſhall bee ſaved.
<note place="margin">Rom. 10.17.</note> 
               <hi>Faith comes by hearing the word preached. Paul</hi> (by Gods bleſſing upon his miniſterial tongue, and lip-labours) be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gat the <hi>Corinthians</hi> unto God, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 4.15. in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>couraged

<note place="margin">Act. 14.21, 22.</note> and licked whole the Churches ſores. Edifying diſcourſe is a great help towards Heaven.</p>
            <p n="3">3 Conſolation, <hi>for God creates the fruit of the lips to bee peace, peace</hi> to ſad ſorrowfull
<note n="m" place="margin">Iſa. 57.19.</note> ſouls, 1 <hi>Theſ.</hi> 5.14</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Barnab as</hi> by his Tongue was a <hi>ſon of Conſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation,</hi> Act 4.36. God poures the oyl of gladneſſe into diſconſolate ſouls, and troubled ſpirits by the mouths of his ſervants; But God ſeldome uſeth ungoverned, vain tongues, as Inſtruments of ſpirituall good to others. If wee would procure the temporal, or promote the eternal good of others; their preſent com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fort or future felicity, then wee ſhould get, uſe, and keep a good tongue in our heads? which is compared by the Holy Ghoſt in Scripture, to the moſt excellent and uſefull things, as</p>
            <p n="1">1 To <hi>choice ſilver,</hi> Prov. 10.20. To <hi>the Tree of life,</hi> Prov. 15.4. that would have given immortality to the eaters, <hi>To a precious Jewel,</hi> Prov. 20.15. To <hi>food,</hi> Prov. 10.21. <hi>To Phy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſick,</hi> or medicine, <hi>Prov.</hi> 12.18. But of theſe ſomething was ſpoken before.</p>
            <p>The fifth and laſt Reaſon is drawn from the conveniency of helps,
<note n="5" place="margin">The conveni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ency of Helps.</note> afforded us for the go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment of the Tongue. As</p>
            <p n="1">1 Other Organs are double. God hath gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven us two eyes, two ears, two hands, two feet; but one tongue, which is more eaſily ru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led than two. Alas, how can wee guide two tongues, that cannot govern one well?</p>
            <p n="2">2 God hath ſet a double fence or guard be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the mouth (<hi>ſcil.</hi> of lips, and of teeth) to
<pb n="113" facs="tcp:120106:65"/>keep the Tongue in, and hath ſhut it up in he mouth as in a Cloiſter or hole of the head, with doors, to ſignifie there is a preci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous treaſure in the Tongue, <hi>linguam velut in ſpecum abdidit,</hi> ſaith <hi>Eraſmus,</hi> to teach it mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deſty, and keep it under reſtraint, and make it ſlow to ſpeak. No other member hath the like. God hath ſo framed the ears, as they ſhould be alway open, and therefore ſwift to hear, and he hath covered the eyes with a thin skin only, for defence and for ſleep.</p>
            <p n="3">3 God gives Reaſon to be a guide to the Tongue, and permits not the uſe of the tongue, before the uſe of Reaſon in ſome meaſure, as we ſee in little Children, who are not ſuffered to ſpeak, till they have ſome un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtanding.</p>
            <p n="4">4 God hath placed the Tongue in the head, which is the ſubject and ſeat of all the ſenſes, both interior, as imagination and me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mory, and exterior, as ſeeing, hearing, ſmel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling, taſting, touching. The Tongue hath near to it the Organs of all theſe ſenſes, as the eyes, ears, noſe; the faculty of taſting is pecu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liar to the Tongue; and though the power of touching be diſperſed through all the parts of the body; yet the tongue hath a more ſubtill, and curious touch than other members, for the taſte is made by the contact of the tongue; which can perceive the leaſt hair that is ming<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led with meat. Therefore our Tongues ſhould not ſpeak, before wee have conſulted with all the neighbouring ſenſes, to get what informa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion they can give us concerning the perſons or things ſpoken of, or to; eſpecially with the
<pb n="114" facs="tcp:120106:66"/>eye and ear which are called ſenſes of Diſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pline, to which the Principality is aſcribed, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe by reading and hearing we may be not only informed of the matter ſpoken of, but inſtructed to ſpeak wiſely and profitably.</p>
            <p>Hence it is</p>
            <p n="1">1
<note place="margin">Eraſmus.</note> That the miniſtry of the Tongue ſhould be the laſt (as one ſaith) of all the members, that is, a man ſhould hear ſee, ſmell, taſte, feel, before he ſpeak; as the ſentence of the Judge followeth after the evidence of the witneſſes, the pleadings of the lawyers, and the verdict of the Jury.</p>
            <p n="2">2 What a man ſpeaks from the knowledge and experiences of the ſenſes, he aſſerts with confidence and boldneſſe,
<note place="margin">1 Joh. 1.1.2, 3.</note> as <hi>John</hi> did. — <hi>That which wee have ſeen and heard</hi> (and our hands have handled) <hi>declare wee unto you.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="3">3 Providence ſo ordereth it, as thoſe that are deaf (many of them) are dumb alſo; be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe they cannot hear inſtruction, nor learn wiſdome to ſpeak aright, therefore they ſhall not ſpeak at all.</p>
            <p n="5">5 God hath placed the Tongue between the heart and the brain, in the confines of both, to take counſel of and to be directed by, both, as well as to bee an interpreter of both.</p>
            <p n="6">6 God gives us his word to be a rule for our tongues to ſpeak by, his Spirit for a guide to direct them in all our words, and his grace to ſeaſon all our ſpeech.</p>
            <p n="7">7 and laſtly, God himſelf is willing to be the keeper both of our mouths (for there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore <hi>David</hi> found in his heart to put up that requeſt to God, in <hi>Pſal.</hi> 141.3. <hi>Set a watch, O

            <p>The more free you are to unboſome your ſelves, and lay open your ſoul-caſes to others, the more forward will they be to pity you, adviſe you, and pray for you, that you may be healed of your ſoul-ſores and conſcience<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wounds, which by concealing may grow in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>curable.

            <p>The Fourth Caſe is a common Judgement, or a particular affliction.</p>
            <p n="1">1 A common Judgement, when a man hath had a ſpeciall hand in pulling down the ſame,

            <p n="2">2
<note n="a" place="margin">particular affliction.</note> A particular affliction; as ſickneſſe; In this caſe you muſt confeſſe your ſins to God chiefly, and you may confeſſe them (eſpeci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally that particular ſin, which you conceive to be the cauſe of your ſickneſſe) to men alſo, as to the Elders of the Church (and to other Chriſtian friends) thereby</p>
            <p n="1">1 To juſtifie God, that he is Righteous, faithfull, yea and mercifull in laying his hand upon you.</p>
            <p n="2">2 To move men (<hi>ſcil,</hi> the Elders, and others)

            </p>
            <p>For the healing both of your ſin and ſick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe of your ſoul and body, may bee a fruit of their prayers to God for you; and their praying for you, an effect of your confeſſing your ſins to them, which if they did not know, they could not ſo fully and feelingly, or would not ſo freely and fervently ſpread your caſe before the Lord, and wreſtle with him for the remiſſion of your ſin, for the recove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry of your health, or for the removal of his hand that lyeth upon you in any other kind.</p>
            <p>This I apprehend to be the Apoſtle <hi>James</hi> his ſenſe and ſcope, in the 14, 15, 16. verſes of his fifth Chapter.</p>
            <p>When men ſuffer as malefactours, they ſhould openly acknowledge their ſin, that Gods juſtice may be cleared in their due, and deſerved puniſhment; for hereby glory is gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven to God (as was ſhewed before in <hi>Achans</hi> caſe) the penitent theef on the Croſſe by ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledging his ſin, juſtified God in condem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning him, and Chriſt in ſuffering with him;

<note place="margin">Pſal. 51.4. Reproof.</note>
            </p>
            <p>The Fifth Caſe is Reproof from others; when they tell you of your faults, you ſhould freely confeſſe them, your grief for them, and purpoſe to amend them. When <hi>Nathan</hi> ſaid to <hi>David, Thou art the man,</hi> — that haſt
<pb n="122" facs="tcp:120106:70"/>kild <hi>Uriah,</hi>

            </p>
            <p>The confeſſion of a fault is an Eccho to a reprehenſion for it.</p>
            <p>Sixth caſe is,
<note place="margin">Copartnerſhip in ſin.</note> Copartnerſhip or conſent with others in ſin as Theft, murder, unclean<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe, drunkenneſſe.</p>
            <p>Thoſe that have had fellowſhip together in ſinne, ſhould confeſſe their ſinnes one to a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nother, to quicken and excite one another to conſider their wayes, (the evils they have done together) to repent and amend, and to pray one for another that they may bee heal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed of their ſinful courſes, and do ſo no more, to help one another out of the ſnares of Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tan, wherein they have been taken captive by him at his will.</p>
            <p>Eſpecially when any of their Conſciences (who have been Companions in iniquity) are awakened to repent of their wickedneſſe, ſay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing <hi>what have I done?</hi>
               <note place="margin">Jer. 8.6</note> they ſhould confeſſe their faults to their fellow-theeves, fellow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>drunkards, fellow-wantons, fellow-murde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rers, to awaken them alſo, to conſider and lay to heart what evils they have com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted together?</p>
            <p>It were to bee wiſhed, that all who have been like <hi>Simion</hi> and <hi>Levi,</hi>

            <p>When affliction had awakened the conſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ences
<pb n="123" facs="tcp:120106:70"/>of <hi>Joſephs</hi> brethren, about their Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpiracy and cruelty againſt him, whom they ſold into <hi>Egypt,</hi> the guilt whereof was (as ſome compute) about twenty years old,
<note place="margin">Annot.</note> though they felt not the ſmart of it till now, then they confeſſed their ſinne, with grief one to another, when they were impriſoned by <hi>Joſeph</hi> for

            </p>
            <p>The good Thief confeſſed his ſinne to his Fellow-malefactor, and rebuked him for rail<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing on Chriſt, <hi>Luk.</hi> 23.39, 40. and counſelled him to fear God—<hi>doſt not thou fear God?</hi> q. d. thou oughteſt to do ſo.</p>

            <p>It is ſeaſonable, and may bee profitable for condemned Malefactors at their Execution, to make an open confeſſion of their ſins before all the ſpectators, eſpecially of thoſe ſinnes which brought them to that untimely end, and to diſſwade all from their ſinfull courſes, as they would avoid their miſerable end.</p>

            <p n="1">1 Wee may bring our ſelves into danger; Suppoſe a man hath committed murder, theft, or the like ſecretly, ſo that it is not known; his own diſcovery of it may coſt him his life, according to that ſaying, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fels and be hanged.

            <p>Secondly, Wee are required to confeſſe ſuch ſinnes to others as are open, or ſome way

The moſt of the forementioned caſes of confeſſion to men, concern ſuch faults as are ſome way known to men, either</p>
            <p n="1">1 Openly in the Acts of them; ſuch are ſcandals given to the Church, or to particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar perſons, ſo long as the ſame are kept ſecret, they are not ſcandalous; and the wrongs wee have done to others in word or deed, — and the evils we have done together with others, as companions in iniquity.</p>
            <p n="2">2 Or by the effect, conſequent, or ſome diſcovering mark thereof.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Achans</hi> theft was kept ſecret; for he hid what he had ſtoln in the earth,
<note place="margin">Ioſh. 7.21.</note> in the midſt of his Tent; but it was diſcovered, firſt, by the blow God gave <hi>Iſrael</hi> for this ſin of <hi>Achan,</hi> call'd <hi>the accurſed thing,</hi> — they were ſmitten at <hi>Ai;</hi> After by caſting of lots (a courſe of Gods preſcribing to find out the offender) and the lot fell upon <hi>Achans</hi> Tribe, family and perſon; thus his iniquity found him out, then he confeſſed his ſin to <hi>Joſhua,</hi> and died for it.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Jonahs</hi> flight from the preſence of the Lord, was a ſecret fault, known only to God and himſelf at firſt, but providence afterward brought it to light; by the Lords ſending a mighty tempeſt upon the Sea, ſo that the ſhip <hi>Jonah</hi> was in, and all that were in it, were in <hi>Jeopardie;</hi> and the Mariners caſting lots to find out who was the cauſe of that evil upon them,

            <p n="3">3 Wee may confeſſe ſometimes even our ſecret ſins to others, to our own advantage, as in the particular caſes before ſpecified; to wit,</p>
            <p n="1">1 Of ſcruple, when they burden our con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſciences.</p>

            <p>— To obtain comfort, counſel, compaſſion and ſupplication from others, and thereby help and remedy againſt ſin and trouble, both of body and ſoul, as was ſhewed before.

            <p n="1">1 To keep our counſel, conceal our infirmi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties, lock up our ſecrets in their boſomes, and not divulge them to our prejudice.</p>
            <p n="2">2 To counſel us aright, concerning our boſome-caſes.</p>
            <p n="3">3 To pity us, and to pray for us.</p>
            <p>Theſe are the properties of boſome-friends.</p>
            <p>Object. <hi>Shall we not hereby loſe our Repute, and blemiſh our name?</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Anſ.</hi> Confeſſion of our ſecret faults to ſuch, will not impair our credit, nor impeach our good name with them, becauſe</p>
            <p n="1">1 They will conſider themſelves that they alſo may be tempted, troubled and exerciſed ſo as wee are; and they will remember that Law of Juſtice and equity, of doing to others what they would have others do to them, <hi>Mat.</hi> 7.12.</p>
            <p n="2">2 The confeſſing of our ſecret ſins to them, upon ſuch an account, will repreſent us to them, to be tender in conſcience, ſoft in heart, humble in ſpirit, hating ſin, fearfull to offend.</p>
            <p>Hereby we ſhall give them occaſion</p>
            <p n="1">1 To diſcern more of the grace of God (of the truth, and workings of it) in us.</p>
            <p n="2">2 To think better, yea more highly of us (as Chriſt did of the Centurion, and of the woman of <hi>Canaan</hi>) the worſe we think, and the more evill we ſpeak of our ſelves this will not leſſen, but greaten our eſteem with them.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="129" facs="tcp:120106:73"/>
The third thing is, from what Principles, or in what manner, we ſhould confeſſe our faults to others, <hi>ſcil.</hi> from Zeal, Hatred, Love, Humility.</p>
            <p n="1">1 Out of Zeal for God,
<note n="1" place="margin">Zeal.</note> to give him glory before men of his 1 <hi>Omniſcience,</hi> knowing our ſins, even the moſt ſecret, and 2 Provi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence in detecting them.</p>
            <p n="2">2 Juſtice in puniſhing, or Righteouſneſſe and faithfulneſs in afflicting us for them.</p>
            <p n="3">3 Free grace in pardoning them, and in ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cepting, imploying and ſaving us from them, or notwithſtanding them.</p>
            <p n="4">4 Patience in ſparing us, and mercy in do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing us good, notwithſtanding the evils we have done.</p>
            <p n="2">2 Out of hatred of ſin,
<note n="2" place="margin">Hatred.</note> we ſhould confeſſe it with grief for it, and aggravation and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſtation of it; as a man would ſpeak of the moſt loathſome, abominable things, as of ea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting or drinking Excrements, or touching of Toads; yea as we would tell or inform others of a moſt notorious Theef, Murderer, or Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lefactor, that hee may be executed, or of a Toad or Snake, that it may be kill'd.</p>
            <p>Yea ſo as by confeſſing our ſins, (to God or man) to caſt them up with loathing as nauſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous ſtuff, as men do meat which their ſto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>macks cannot digeſt, but loathe. For confeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion is a vomit of the ſoul, whereby it caſts up or ſpuos out ſin, and disburthens it ſelf of it, which lay heavy upon it, and made the ſoul ſick.</p>
            <p n="3">3
<note n="3" place="margin">Love.</note> Out of love to others to make ſin odious and abominable to them; and to make them
<pb n="130" facs="tcp:120106:74"/>abhor and eſchew the ſins we have commit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted, and eſcape ſhame and ſorrow that wee have taſted for the ſame — alſo out of grief, for wronging or offending others, and from a juſt mind to give them ſatisfaction by confeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion thereof to them, to obtain their pardon and favour.</p>
            <p n="4">4
<note n="4" place="margin">Humility.</note> Out of humility, to humble our ſelves, for our faults even before men (in the caſes, or upon the occaſions premiſed) to take ſhame to our ſelves, in confeſſing them; and to make it appear how much we abhor ſin, and our ſelves for ſin, and how vile we are in our own eyes; alſo, to prevent others thinking too highly of us, which was <hi>Pauls</hi> deſire, who would not have others to think him better than he was, 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 12.6.</p>
            <p>We ſhould bewail the neglect of, and a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſeneſſe to this duty, in all ſorts, even from young to old, the moſt are more forward</p>
            <p n="1">1 To commit ſin with others, or to incou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rage others unto ſin.</p>
            <p n="2">2 To deny, hide, or excuſe their ſins; even when they are taxed and reproved for them.</p>
            <p n="3">3 Or to outface their faults, and juſtifie them, than to confeſſe them to others.</p>
            <p>It is the property of ſinners, and the infirmity of Saints (who are but as Infants in meaſure, and ſanctified but in part) to palliate and co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver their ſins as much as they can; This hath been their manner from the beginning; or from ſins entrance into the World. See it in our firſt Parents. <hi>Adam</hi> layed the blame of his ſin upon <hi>Eve,</hi> and <hi>Eve</hi> of her ſin upon the Serpent, <hi>Sarah</hi> covered her laughter with a
<pb n="131" facs="tcp:120106:74"/>lye; ſhe feared a reproof for what ſhe had done,
<note place="margin">Gen 18.15.</note> but ſhe was not afraid to deſerve it by denying what ſhe had done.</p>
            <p>What a miſerable ſort of excuſes will bee pleaded (ſaith one) when men are charged with ſin, for all are graven out of <hi>Adam.</hi>
               <note place="margin">Mr. Greenham.</note>
            </p>
            <p>I have read a Proverb, that ſin ſeweth it ſelf a garment (being aſhamed to go naked) that is, excuſes, invented by Satan, but made by men and women, as the ſuit of fig-leaves were by <hi>Adam</hi> and <hi>Eve,</hi> who were the firſt offen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders; but they cannot cover ſins nakedneſſe, nor keep it warm, nor put any comlineſs upon it, for the excuſe of ſin multiplies ſin, and makes addition thereunto.</p>
            <p>Queſt. <hi>Why are men ſo backward to confeſſe ſin?</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Anſ.</hi> 1. Becauſe confeſſion of ſin contains in it, or brings ſhame and grief along with it for ſin, which ſin cannot indure. They are as ſmoak to the eyes, Vinegar to the teeth, bit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter as Gall and wormwood to the taſte of ſin.</p>
            <p>Sin hath ſo perverted the ſoul, as to miſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>place ſhame in acknowledging offences, which ſhould be placed in offending.</p>
            <p n="2">2 Confeſſion is an Ejection of ſin (as it is ſaid) where ſin is freely confeſſed, it is fully caſt out; It layes an ingagement upon men, not to commit ſin again, when they have con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſed it, but abſolutely to hate it, to part with it, and put it away. This neither Satan nor ſin (its brat) can indure. They hate putting away, where they have gotten poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeſſion, they deſire to hold it. Confeſſion ſepa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rates between ſin and ſoul, and makes a di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vorce.</p>
            <p n="3">
               <pb n="132" facs="tcp:120106:75"/>
3 Becauſe Confeſſion is a bringing of ſin (that horrid Monſter) to light; an open diſco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very of it in its ſhape and colours, which are moſt ugly and deformed. Now ſin hates the light,
<note place="margin">Joh. 3.20.</note> and hates comming to the light, and hates Confeſſion which cauſeth it; and hides it ſelf in the boſome of the ſinner. Satan im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ploys all his pollicy, and ſin all its power and intereſt it hath in us to conceal it, and to wave the confeſſion of it. Sin loves to wear a veil of ſecrecy, or a vizzard of counterfeit piety, or a Garment of excuſes, that the filth and ſhame of its nakedneſſe may not appear; or to wrap it ſelf like the Devil in <hi>Samuels</hi> mantle.</p>
            <p>As falſe Prophets come to us in ſheep cloa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing, ſo doth ſin in the guiſe, colour or ſhew of vertue, to deceive us.</p>
            <p>Object. <hi>Sin is a filthy, ſhamefull thing, it becommeth Saints not once to name it, as Forni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation, <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>ncleanneſſe, Covetouſneſſe,</hi> Epheſ. 5.3. <hi>why then ſhould we confeſſe it?</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Anſ.</hi> 1. Though ſin bee filthy and abomi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nable in it ſelf, yet the Confeſſion of ſin is clean and commendable.</p>
            <p n="2">2 There is difference between naming, and naming of ſin, <hi>ſcil.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="1">1 With delight in it, boaſting of it, or indul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gence to it, This naming of ſin is ſin.</p>
            <p n="2">2 Or with deteſtation of it, and indignation at it, and grief for it, This naming of ſin is good and gracious.</p>
            <p n="3">3 To conceal ſin, but not to confeſſe it (when there is occaſion) is ſinfull modeſty, (ſhamefull ſhamefaſtneſſe) to keep Satans counſell; to hide and harbour a Theef or mur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derer
<pb n="133" facs="tcp:120106:75"/>in our boſomes, that will rob our ſouls, and cut our throats; this argueth ſtubborn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe of ſpirit, and ſelf-hardening againſt re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proof. Such a diſpoſition is the high-way to deſtruction. <hi>For he that covereth his ſins,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Prov. 28.13</note> (that is, who will not confeſſe them, no not when he is called thereunto) <hi>ſhall not proſper — and he that being often reproved hardeneth his neck</hi> (re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fuſing to confeſſe or to amend his fault) <hi>ſhall ſuddenly be deſtroyed, and that without reme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="4">4 A ſerious and religious confeſſion of ſin, is a Remedy to cleanſe and heal ſoul-mala<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies. The firſt peece of amends for our ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning is to confeſſe our ſins. The hiding of ſin is like the covering or skinning of a ſore, which will feſter inwardly, and break out dangerouſly. What a reſtraint would this be to ſin, to take liberty to do nothing (no not ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cretly) which we would not take boldneſſe to confeſſe even openly?</p>
            <p>To Confeſſe ſinne aright is an Herb of Grace which grows not in natures Garden; when a man is condemned in himſelf through deep Conviction and ſenſe of ſinne, hee will bee free to accuſe himſelf before others; when hee feels the bitterneſſe of ſinne in his Soul, he will caſt it up as loathſome ſtuff, though hee ſwallowed it down as a ſweet mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſel.</p>
            <p>Many famous men (as <hi>Auſtine, Origen,</hi> and others) have been free to publiſh the Errors of their opinions to the world.</p>
            <p>Why ſhould we be unwilling to confeſſe the Errors of our manners?</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="134" facs="tcp:120106:76"/>
               <hi>Rom.</hi> 10.10. — With the heart man be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieveth unto righteouſneſſe, and with the mouth confeſſion is made <hi>unto Salvation.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>HEre is a double duty annexed to two principal parts of man.—</p>
            <p n="1">1 The Duty of the Heart, that is faith, and the effect thereof is Righteouſneſſe; that is, we are juſtified by faith, apprehending the righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teouſneſs of Chriſt.</p>
            <p n="2">2 The Duty of the Mouth, that is, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſion, and the conſequent of it is Salvation.</p>
            <p>Obſerve the order and Connexion of theſe two.</p>
            <p n="1">1 The order, the Heart goeth before the Tongue, and Believing before Confeſsing.</p>
            <p n="2">2 The Connexion of them, as of the cauſe with the effect, for Faith in the Heart is the Root, or principle of confeſſion with the Mouth; both ſhould go together as fire and flame, as ſpring and ſtream, as Tree and fruit.</p>
            <p>Doctrine;</p>
            <p>
               <hi>It is a Goſpel-Duty to confeſſe with the Mouth, as well as to beleeve with the Heart.</hi>

            <p>I deſire to open four things.</p>
            <p n="1">1 What this Confeſſion is, 2 When it ſhould be made, 3 Why, 4 How.</p>
            <p n="1">1 What it is. This Confeſſion is an open Profeſſion of Chriſt,
<note place="margin">What Confeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion is.</note> and his Goſpel, Truths and wayes and a pleading for the ſame.</p>
            <p n="1">1 Of Chriſt of whole Chriſt.</p>
            <p n="1">1 Of his Natures, or divinity and huma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity. The woman of <hi>Canaan</hi> confeſſed Chriſt to bee <hi>Lord, and the Son of David,</hi> that is, to

<note place="margin">Act. 24.16.</note> or Bias of our Reſolu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions and indeavours — <hi>Paul</hi> alſo confeſſed this before <hi>Felix — Herein do I exerciſe my ſelf, to have alwayes a conſcience void of offence towards God,

            <p n="5">5 Confeſsion is an open Profeſsion of our experiences of God, and of his gracious dea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lings with us; of Chriſt and of his Grace in us, love to us, and of our fellowſhip with him. — The account <hi>David</hi> gave to them that feared God was a confeſsion of his expe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riences,
<note place="margin">Pſal. 66.16.</note> — <hi>Come and hear all yee that fear God, and I will declare what hee hath done for my ſoul</hi> — Such was <hi>Johns</hi> firſt Epiſtle, wherein he declares to all,
<note place="margin">1 Joh. 1.1, 3.</note> that which the Apoſtles have ſeen, heard, and felt. — Relations of experiences are Confeſsions of Chriſt before men. I may adde, that to bear witneſſe a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt ſin, is to give Teſtimony for God, which is good and acceptable ſervice to God, though wee ſuffer for it, as <hi>John</hi> the Baptiſt loſt his head for witneſsing againſt <hi>Herods</hi> Adultery, and Inceſt, <hi>Mar.</hi> 6.18, 27.</p>

The ſecond thing.
<note n="2" place="margin">When.</note> When this Confeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion ſhould bee made, to wit, when wee are called thereunto, either publickly or pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vately.</p>
            <p n="1">1 Publickly, either by a Church, or by a Magiſtrate.</p>
            <p n="1">1 By a Church of Chriſt, either</p>

            <p n="2">2 Or at our admiſſion into it.</p>
            <p n="1">1 At the Conſtitution of it; for the Lord Jeſus makes the confeſsion of faith to be the Rock or foundation upon which his viſible Church is built, <hi>Mat.</hi> 16.16. to 19. Therefore when he firſt was about to tell his Apoſtles of building his Church of a new frame or model under the Goſpel, the old Fabrick of the <hi>Jew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iſh</hi> Church being then to be taken down about the time of Chriſts paſsion, and the new to be ſet up after his aſſenſion, according to his commiſsion and direction given to his Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtles to that purpoſe, <hi>Act.</hi> 1.2, 3. — beeing ſeen of them forty dayes, (after his Reſurrecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on) and ſpeaking (to them) of the things per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taining to the Kingdome of God, that is, his Church, hee firſt requires an account or con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſsion of their Faith. <hi>Whom ſay yee that I am?</hi>
               <note place="margin">Verſ. 15.</note> Then <hi>Peter</hi> anſwered in the name of all the Apoſtles, (as our ſound, Orthodox Divines conceive) <hi>Thou art Chriſt the Son of the li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving God,</hi> Therefore <hi>Peter</hi> ſaith, in <hi>John</hi> 6.69. not I only, but <hi>wee</hi> (Apoſtles) <hi>beleeve and are ſure that thou art that Chriſt, the Son of the Living God,</hi> and Chriſt replyed, <hi>thou art</hi> Peter, <gap reason="foreign">

               </gap>,
<note place="margin">Mat. 16.18</note> that is, upon this confeſsion made of mee to be the Chriſt, or upon mee the rock as confeſſed, <hi>I will build my Church and the gates of Hell ſhall not prevail againſt it</hi> — Hence we may collect two things.</p>
            <p n="1">1 That a good confeſsion of Faith in Chriſt ſhould bee made and laid as a foundation at the gathering or conſtituting of Churches (to build them upon) which may bee effectual to keep them ſound in the faith, and free from errours, and to ingage them to hold faſt their principles, and not to ſwarve from the ſame; but to preſerve the doctrin of Religion pure therein, and to ſtrengthen the whole build<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing that is raiſed upon it —</p>
            <p n="2">2 That thoſe are the fitteſt ſtones for the building of a Church, that can give the beſt account of their faith in Chriſt.</p>
            <p n="2">2 At our Admiſsion into a Church of Chriſt, to which wee deſire to joyn our ſelves, and they require us to give an account of our faith and holineſſe, that wee are Saints and Beleevers — This we ſhould be free and ready to do.</p>
            <p n="1">1 Becauſe as to beleeve with the heart, makes a man a member of the inviſible Church, ſo to confeſſe with the mouth; or open profeſsion of faith, qualifies him to bee a member of a viſible Church of Chriſt.</p>
            <p n="2">2 This will give the Church knowledge of us, and ſatisfaction in us, yea move them to glorify God for us, and to receive us in the Lord unto fellowſhip with them in all Chriſts
<pb n="141" facs="tcp:120106:79"/>Ordinances, without which they may bee afraid of us, as the Church of <hi>Jeruſalem</hi> was of <hi>Paul,</hi> when hee aſſaied to joyn himſelf to it until <hi>Barnabas</hi> had ſatisfied them concerning him, <hi>Act.</hi> 9.26, 27.</p>
            <p n="3">3 This ſeems to have been the practice of the Primitive Church (as now it is of the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed Churches) — The 3000 converted at <hi>Peters</hi> Sermon, did not they confeſſe Chriſt,
<note place="margin">Act. 2.</note> or make a profeſsion of their faith, and of a change wrought in them? Elſe how could the Apoſtles know that they gladly received the word (to wit, of faith, repentance,
<note place="margin">Verſ. 41.</note> and obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience to the Goſpel) and diſtinguiſh them from all others, and upon that account bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſe them? — I am apt to think that thoſe who beleeved at <hi>Epheſus,</hi> confeſſed their Saviour, as well as their ſinnes, and their Faith as well as their Repentance.</p>
            <p n="4">4 What is done at the planting of a Church is proper and ſuitable to bee done in the aug<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentation of it, that is, confeſsion of Faith — whoſoever would bee a <hi>Peter,</hi> that is,
<note place="margin">1 Pet. 2.5</note> a lively ſtone, fit to be laid in this building, ſhould be a confeſſour of Chriſt.</p>
            <p n="2">2 When wee are called thereunto by a Magiſtrate, or ſecular powers, or brought before Rulers, and Governours for Chriſts ſake, and examined about our Religion; then wee ought to bear witneſſe to Chriſt, and his Truth, as Chriſt and his Apoſtles did. —</p>
            <p n="1">1 Chriſt who witneſſed a good confeſſion before <hi>Pontius Pilate</hi> (then Preſident in <hi>Jude<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>a</hi>) recorded in <hi>John.</hi> 18.37.
<note place="margin">1 Tim. 6.1</note> — <hi>when Pilate ſaid unto him art thou a King?</hi> Jeſus anſwered;
<pb n="142" facs="tcp:120106:80"/>
               <hi>Thou ſayeſt that I am a King.</hi> This is an He<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brew manner of confeſſion, aequivalent to an affirmation, <hi>q. d.</hi> that thou ſayeſt is true, I am ſo indeed; Chriſt did the like before the Council,

               <hi>when they all ſaid, art thou the Son of God? and he ſaid unto them, ye ſay that I am, q. d.</hi> I am what you ſay — and before the High-Prieſt when hee asked him, <hi>Art thou the Chriſt the Sonne of the bleſſed?

<note place="margin">1 Pet. 3.15</note> to give an anſwer to every man that asketh you a reaſon of the hope that is in you with meekneſſe and reverence.</hi> Now to give a reaſon of our hope what is it, but to yield an account of our faith? which wee are bound to do upon a private demand: or when juſt occaſion is given, though but by a private perſon, as Chriſt made confeſsion of himſelf to the <hi>Samaritan</hi> woman, and to a blind man.

<note place="margin">John. 10.24</note> if thou bee the Chriſt tell us plainly.</hi> But hee would not in plain Termes tell them that hee was hee, becauſe hee knew their hearts, that they asked not ſincerely to beleeve in him, but captiouſly to get advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tage againſt him; though hee told the wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man, becauſe Chriſt knew, ſhee was now a Convert, and would bee a means of the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſion of others. — When the blind man asked Chriſt, who was the Sonne of God, that hee might beleeve in him; though the <hi>Phariſees</hi> had excommunicated him for confeſſing Chriſt, yet Chriſt confeſſeth him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf to him — and tells him — <hi>It is hee that talketh with thee, Joh.</hi> 7.35, 36, 37. <hi>And hee ſaid, Lord, I beleeve, and hee worſhipped him.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Second Caſe. Wee are cal'd to confeſſe Chriſt, when wee are engaged in diſputes or reaſonings with others about the matters of Chriſt and his Goſpel,
<note place="margin">Jud. 3</note> then <hi>we ſhould contend earneſtly for the faith which was once delivered
<pb n="144" facs="tcp:120106:81"/>unto the Saints;</hi> for defence of the Truth, and to convince gainſayers. Even as <hi>Iſaacks</hi> Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vants ſtrove with the <hi>Philiſtims</hi> for the well of water they had found,

<note place="margin">Phil. 1.17</note> 
               <hi>is ſet for the defence of the Goſpel,</hi> as well as <hi>Paul.</hi> — How plain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly and boldly did <hi>Paul</hi> confeſſe Chriſt, and how ſtrenuouſly did hee contend for the Truth as it is in Jeſus,
<note place="margin">Act. 19.29</note> in his diſputes with the <hi>Grecians</hi> at Jeruſalem? <hi>but they went about to ſlay him.</hi> Hee being too hard for them at arguments, they would bee too ſharp for him at weapons; — with the Jews and devout perſons in the Synagogue, and in the market daily with them that met with him,
<note place="margin">Act. 17.18</note> and with certain Philoſophers at <hi>Athens,</hi> where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in hee ſtoutly maintained, that the God who made heaven,

<note place="margin">Verſ. 30, 31</note> is the only true God, — and the doctrin of repentance, of the laſt judgement, and of the Reſurrection.
<note place="margin">Verſ. 18, 19, 20</note> For which diſpute, the Philoſophers perſecuted him, and brought him unto <hi>Areopagus</hi> (that was the high Court of Juſtice in <hi>Athens</hi>) as a violator of their Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion, to bee judged.—<hi>Paul</hi> and <hi>Barnabas</hi> were ſtout Champions for the Truth in their Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>putes at <hi>Antioch</hi> with the Jews,
<note place="margin">Act. 15.2</note> that maintain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed the neceſſity of Circumciſion — <hi>Ste<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phen</hi> in his diſpute with the Doctors of five ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veral Claſſes,
<note place="margin">Act. 6.9.</note>
               <note place="margin">Verſ. 10.</note> ſo confounded them, that they were not able to refiſt the wiſdome of the Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit by which hee ſpake; then they fell to Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tanical Artifices, as to ſubornation of falſe witneſſes againſt him,
<note place="margin">Verſ. 11, 12, &amp;c.</note> and perſecution of him, even unto death. Contending for the truth of
<pb n="145" facs="tcp:120106:81"/>Chriſt, is confeſſing of Chriſt before men.</p>
            <p>This is a Goſpel-becomming converſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion among Chriſtians,
<note place="margin">Phil. 1.27</note> which <hi>Paul</hi> preſſed upon the Philippians, that whether hee was preſent or abſent <hi>hee might hear of their af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fairs; that they ſtand faſt in one ſpirit, with one mind, ſtriving together for the Goſpel,</hi>

               </gap>, or wreſtling together for the defence of the Truth — <hi>Pauls</hi> Zeal in ſtriving for the Truth, and for every parcel of it (be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe precious to him) doth further appear by four things.</p>
            <p n="1">1 He chid the <hi>Galatians</hi> for their Levity,
<note place="margin">Gal. 1.16.</note> that they were ſo ſoon drawn away from the Truth; — and hee curſeth them that bring any other Goſpel (than what hath been preached unto them) whoſoever they bee, whether men or Angels — and? in Chapter 3, verſe 1,
<note place="margin">Gal. 3.1</note> He rebukes them ſharply for being carried away from their obedience to the Truth of the Goſpel. <hi>O fooliſh Galatians who hath bewitched you?</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="2">2
<note place="margin">Gal. 2.4, 5</note> The falſe Brethren that crept in privily to ſpy out the liberty which the Apoſtles had in Chriſt Jeſus (from legal obſervances) <hi>Paul</hi> yielded not an inch to them,

            <p n="3">3 When <hi>Peter</hi> diſſembled, and halted be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween two Opinions (<hi>ſcil.</hi> his eating, and nor eating with the Gentiles) &amp; he (&amp; others fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowing his example) did not <gap reason="foreign">

            <p n="4">4 <hi>Paul</hi> wiſhed that the corrupters of Chriſts Truth, or vehement Urgers of Circumciſion (who troubled or unſetled the <hi>Galatians</hi>) were cut off,
<note place="margin">Gal. 5.12.</note> to wit, as ſuperfluous fleſh, that themſelves might ſuffer what they do.</p>
            <p>The Third Caſe, when we are in company where the Name of Chriſt is blaſphemed, or his Truths, ways, Servants, are evil ſpoken of, contradicted, or calumniated, Then ought <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 word">

In this caſe confeſsion of Chriſt is neceſſary, though we be not examined about him, or his. — Thus I have ſhewed when we ought to confeſs with our mouthes; at other times we have liberty to conceal our Faith, and opinions, yea, our perſons ſometimes, as Chriſt himſelf did.</p>
            <p>The Third Thing, why ought we to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſe with the mouth? The Reaſons may be drawn from God, Chriſt, our ſelves, and others.</p>

            <p n="2">2 Becauſe God the Father did confeſſe, or give Teſtimony, even by a voice from Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven; to his Son Jeſus Chriſt, both at his Bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſm, <hi>Mat.</hi> 3.17. and at his transfiguration, <hi>Mat.</hi> 17.5. ſaying, <hi>This is my beloved Son in whom I am well pleaſed.

            <p n="1">1 It is Chriſts priviledge to be confeſſed; or a high Exaltation, or honorificall event, which was either conferred by the Father on his Son, as a reward of his deep humiliation, as <hi>Piſcator,</hi> and others think; or at leaſt was a conſequent of it as <hi>Calvin</hi> conceives, <hi>quod dictio illativa,</hi> in <hi>Phil.</hi> 2.9. <hi>conſequentiam hic magis ſonet, quam cauſam.</hi> That wherefore in <hi>Phil.</hi> 2.9. denotes rather his exaltation to be a conſequent of his humilia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,

To this end God gives us plain, pregnant, plentifull proofs thereof, more diſcoveries of himſelf, and his Truth, and more of his grace than to others, that we may ſpeak more of, and for God than others. Our eyes ſee, and our ears hear that of Chriſt, and his Goſpel, which others do not (as Chriſt told his Diſciples, <hi>Mat.</hi> 13.16.) There<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore God expects a larger Teſtimony from our mouthes, than others can, or will give of him. — To this end we are born again, and are made partakers of the divine nature, and are of the Truth, that is, of the ſtock, and Linage of Truth — and for this cauſe were wee ſent into the World to give teſtimony to Chriſt, and to the Truth in our Generation. It is great dignity to be a witneſſe of Chriſt. <hi>John</hi> Baptiſt (that great Prophet) <hi>came for a witneſſe of the light,</hi> that is, Chriſt, <hi>John</hi> 1.7 <hi>John</hi> the E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vangeliſt the beloved Diſciple, was an eminent witneſs of Chriſt, both by word and writing, <hi>Joh.</hi> 21.24.

            <p>Fourthly, Becauſe if we confeſſe Chriſt a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>right we ſhall be ſaved. Confeſſion is unto ſal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation (ſaith <hi>Paul</hi> in the Text) in the tenden<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy, and efficacy of it,</p>
            <p n="1">1 As a way appointed us by God to walk in towards heaven.</p>

            <p>The fourth thing is, How this confeſſion ſhould bee made, which ſhall be laid forth in ſeven particulars.</p>
            <p>Firſt, Freely without compulſion; Confeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion of Chriſt ſhould bee a free wil-offering of our mouths, as well as thanskgiving. God loveth a cheerfull giver of Teſtimony to Chriſt, as well as of Charity to men-God loveth not extorted confeſſions, that are wrung from us by violence. He would have them flow freely from us like water out of the fountain, not to be forced from us like wine forth of the preſſe.</p>
            <p n="2">2 Plainly and fully without obſcurity, or partiality, without hiding, or mincing the Truth. Like <hi>John</hi> the Baptiſt, when the Jews ſent Prieſts and Levites to ask him, <hi>who art thou, hee confeſſed and denied not, but confeſſed;</hi>
               <note place="margin">John. 1.19 Verſ. 20</note> (that is plainly, openly, expreſly, fully,) <hi>I am not the Chriſt — But behold there commeth one af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter mee, whoſe ſhooes I am not worthy to looſe,</hi> (Act. 13.25) Hence our confeſſion of Chriſt ſhould grow and flow from Faith, and experience, as the Root and Fountain there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of.</p>
            <p n="1">1 From our faith in Chriſt; Confeſsion in the Mouth (as was noted before) ſhould pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceed from faith in the heart. — <hi>Wee having the

We ſhould ſay of Chriſt only what we know and beleeve, elſe wee do but ſpeak of Chriſt, not confeſſe him. If Chriſt live not in our hearts by Faith (as one ſaith) he will not dwell in our mouthes by confeſsion.</p>
            <p>Object.
<note place="margin">Rom. 14.22.</note> 
               <hi>Doth not</hi> Paul <hi>ſay, Haſt thou Faith? have it to thy ſelf before God;</hi> therefore we need not confeſs it before men.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Anſ.</hi> The Apoſtle there ſpeaks not of a juſtifying Faith (as he doth in my Text) for that muſt be declared by confeſſion, but of a Faith or perſwaſion of Chriſtian liberty in things indifferent (as eating fleſh, and drink<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Wine at that time) this Faith a man may keep to himſelf, or ſo ſhew and uſe it, as hee ſhall not thereby offend his Brother.</p>
            <p n="2">2 From our experience (in ſome meaſure) of Chriſt and his grace, or of what we teſtifie. This will provoke us to confeſſe Chriſt before men, as it did <hi>Peter,</hi> and <hi>John,</hi> when they were commanded ſilence — <hi>Wee cannot but ſpeak the things which wee have ſeen and heard.</hi>
               <note place="margin">Act. 4.18, 19, 20.</note> — They that have experience of the ſweetneſſe and efficacy of Chriſts Word, Truth and Wayes, they muſt and will ſay all they can for the Truth, and nothing at all againſt it, as <hi>Paul</hi> ſpeaks, 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 13.8. — Hence Chriſt gave his Apoſtles experience, or made them ſome way witneſſes (either by the ear, or eye, or

            <p>Sixth Sincerely, Out of Love, and Zeal.</p>
            <p n="1">1 Out of Love to Chriſt and his truth; for what wee love, wee will own, or avouch o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>penly. — Confeſſion, and commendation are fruits of love. Love knows no ſhame in ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledging, and praiſing its beloved Lov<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers are the freeſt and largeſt Confeſſers, and Commenders. See it in the Spouſe, her Encomium of Chriſt, her beloved (from head to foot) when the Daughters of <hi>Jeruſalem</hi> asked her, what is thy beloved, more than another beloved? <hi>Cant.</hi> 5.9. to the end; when love to Chriſt, and to his truth move us to confeſs him and it, then we will ſpeak liberal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, yea all that we can poſſibly for them, who<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoever ſaith nay thereto. Love is ſtrong as death, and the love of Chriſt will conſtrain
<pb n="163" facs="tcp:120106:90"/>us to confeſſe Chriſt to death; yea though wee die for it. — Hence <hi>John</hi> who was the beſt beloved, and moſt loving Diſciple, gave ſpecial Teſtimony of Chriſt, <hi>Joh.</hi> 19.35. and 21.24. — Thoſe that leave their firſt love, grow loath, and averſe to confeſſe Chriſt.</p>
            <p n="2">2 Out of Zeal for God; for the glory of his name, the credit of his cauſe, the honour of his truth, the propagation of his Goſpell; for the encouragement, and comfort of Chriſts Friends, for the conviction and ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruction of his enemies; — not to get praiſe to our ſelves, nor to ſeek our own glory, for love of praiſe is a great prejudice to the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſion of Chriſt.
<note place="margin">Joh. 12.42, 43</note> Some among the chief Rulers did not confeſſe Chriſt, for they lov<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed the praiſe of men more than the praiſe of God.— The Sanctuary fire of zeal kindled from heaven in our hearts, will burn out that Lukewarmneſs, Neutrality, and indif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferency of ſpirit, which makes us to bee of <hi>Gallio's</hi> temper in the things of God, careleſſe of ſuch matters, what any ſay, or do againſt the Name, or truth, wayes, or Kingdome of Chriſt; what errors, hereſies, and blaſphe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies are broached, diſperſed or maintained. — This will alſo conſume to aſhes, the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceits of the <hi>Libertines</hi> and <hi>Familiſts,</hi> who think it lawfull to diſſemble their faith, e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven before the Magiſtrate; and of the <hi>Nico<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demites</hi> of theſe dayes, who count it ſuffici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent to beleeve with the heart taking liberty to confeſſe what they liſt with their mouth.</p>
            <p>Seventh and laſt, Wee muſt confeſſe Chriſt patiently, with a diſpoſition and reſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lution
<pb n="164" facs="tcp:120106:91"/>to ſuffer for our Teſtimony, if God call us to it; becauſe the confeſſing of Chriſt before men may coſt us dear, the loſſe of Liberty, goods, Friends, yea life and all; as it did the Apoſtles,
<note place="margin">Mat. 10.37, 38, 39.</note> and many other the faithfull witneſſes of Chriſt. Chriſt requires wee ſhould bee willing to part with all upon that Account. — Confeſſing of Chriſt hath been a cauſe of ſuffering for Chriſt, ever ſince Chriſts time. Satan and his inſtruments have raiſed oppoſition, and perſecution againſt the profeſsion of Faith, as well as againſt the practice of piery, and againſt the perſons that have held forth the ſame, even from Generation to Generation. — <hi>The Jews a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greed that if any man did confeſſe Chriſt,
<note place="margin">Joh. 9.22 Rev. 1.9</note> he ſhould bee put out of the Synagogue.</hi>— John <hi>was baniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed into the Iſle of</hi> Patmos <hi>for the word of God, and for the Teſtimony</hi> (hee gave) <hi>of Jeſus Chriſt</hi> — When the Lamb had opened the fifth Seal,
<note place="margin">Rev. 6.9</note> 
               <hi>John ſaw under the Altar, the ſouls of them that were ſlain</hi> (under the Roman Emperours) <hi>for the word of God, and for the Teſtimony which they held.</hi>
               <note place="margin">Rev. 11.3</note> — The two witneſſes of Chriſt prophecy in Sack-cloath; and when they have finiſhed their Teſtimony,
<note place="margin">Verſ. 7</note> they ſhall bee ſlain by the Beaſt (to wit of <hi>Rome,</hi> that is Anti-Chriſt) and the inhabitants of the earth (that is of the Malignant or Antichriſtian Church) ſhall rejoyce thereat, and make merry, and as a congratulation of their riddance, ſend gifts one to another.— This was the cauſe of the Dragons quarrel with a remnant of the Womans ſeed <hi>(ſcil.)
<note place="margin">Rev. 12.17</note> they kept the Commande<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments of God, and had the Teſtimony of Jeſus

            <p n="1">1 Preparatives to it, which are four; Wiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome, Righteouſneſs, Faithfullneſs, and Bold<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe. The qualifications of a reprover.</p>
            <p n="1">1
<note place="margin">Wiſdome.</note> Wiſdome to underſtand the whole bu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſineſs of reproof, what belongs to the Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance and Circumſtances to the matter, man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner, and opportunies thereof, <hi>wiſdome is profi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>table to direct</hi> herein, <hi>Eccleſ.</hi> 10.10. for the regular performance of reproof. The wiſe man commends wiſdome upon this accompt, — <hi>As an ear-ring of gold, and an ornament of fine gold; ſo is a wiſe reprover upon an obedient ear,</hi> Prov. 25.12. It hath a redoubled excellen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cie. A wiſe reprover is ſuch a one as can fit the reproof to the ear of the reproved, and hang it on handſomely (as a Jewel) and fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſten it to ſtay. A wiſe mans reproof thus taking effect, becomes a great ornament to the reproved, who is thereby reformed, even as a Diamond in a Diadem. Wiſdome is re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quired in a reprover, and obedience in the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proved. A ſeaſonable reproof is more bene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficiall to him that receives and obeys it, than
<pb n="167" facs="tcp:120106:92"/>if the reprover ſhould adorn his ear with an ear-ring, or beſtow a precious Jewel upon him; ſpirituall garniſhings with grace are far more glorious than all external deckings of Nature or Art. <hi>It is better to hear the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bukes of the wiſe,</hi> ſaith the Preacher,
<note place="margin">Eccl. 7.5.</note> 
               <hi>than the ſongs of fooles;</hi> their jeaſts, fancies or flatte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries. Wiſdome makes Chriſtians able or po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent to admoniſh one another, as it did the <hi>Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mans,</hi> and it ſends forth a reproof with force,
<note place="margin">Rom. 15.14.</note> as an arrow out of a Bow, to make it flye and hit the mark. The words of the wiſe have weight.</p>
            <p n="2">2 Preparative is Righteouſneſs;
<note place="margin">Righteouſneſs.</note> we are fit to reprove faults in others, when we are free, eſpecially from thoſe faults in our ſelves; to blame others, when we are blameleſſe, elſe they may ſay to us, <hi>Phyſician heal thy ſelf;</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gin at home, firſt to reform thy ſelf, then re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prove us; ſhall vice reprove ſin? <hi>Thou Hypo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crite</hi> (ſaith Chriſt) <hi>firſt caſt the Beam out of thine own eye,
<note place="margin">Mat. 7.5.</note> then thou ſhalt ſee clearly to pull the mote out of thy Brothers eye.</hi> It was <hi>Davids</hi> not only conceſſion but petition, <hi>Let the Righteous</hi> (that is, he who is godly and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blameable in himſelf) <hi>ſmite mee,</hi> ſcil. with a rod of reproof, <hi>and it ſhall be a kindneſs.</hi> The reproof of the Righteous carries healing under its wings, and authority to cauſe (yea to com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand) entrance and obedience.</p>
            <p n="3">3
<note place="margin">Faithfulneſs.</note> Preparative is Faithfulneſſe to God and man.</p>
            <p n="1">1 To God, to tender his glory, and by re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proof to prevent ſin in others, and the diſho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour that might come thereby to Gods Name.</p>
            <p n="2">
               <pb n="168" facs="tcp:120106:93"/>
2 To man, To love our neighbour as our ſelves, and to ſeek his good as our own, even the ſalvation of his Soul; (the chief good of all) and to prevent evil from him, as well as from our ſelves, eſpecially ſinne which is the greateſt evil; and that by reproof, which is a means of prevention of it, as well as of re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>covery from it. It is good ſervice to prevent ſin.
<note place="margin">Prov. 27.6</note> 
               <hi>Faithfull are the wounds of a friend (that is reproof)</hi> ſaith the wiſe man, <hi>but the kiſſes</hi> (that is fawnings and flatteries) <hi>of an enemy are de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceitful.</hi> Then faithfulneſſe fits us for repro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving. As wiſdome gives direction, ſo faith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fulneſſe layeth an obligation to the duty. He is a faithfull man who zealouſly indeavou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reth to keep diſhonour from God, and ſinne from man, or man from ſinne. It is faithful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs to reprove a brother, or neighbour, when he offends.</p>
            <p>Fourth,
<note place="margin">Boldneſſe.</note> Is boldneſſe and courage not to fear the faces or frowns of others, for that will ſtop our mouths from giving even juſt and neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſary reproofs. Now wiſdome, righteouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe and faithfulneſs breeds boldneſſe.</p>
            <p n="2">II Rules for reproof, which reſpect</p>
            <p n="1">1 The matter what. 2 The perſons whom. 3 The manner how. 4 The ſeaſon when we ſhould reprove.</p>
            <p n="1">1
<note place="margin">The matter.</note> The matter to be reproved. The Rules for it are two.</p>
            <p>Firſt, The chief matter or principal object of reproof is ſinne againſt God or man; Any thing that is a tranſgreſsion of the Law of God, or a violation of the juſt laws of men, not only haynous crimes, but leſſer faults, as diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>orderly
<pb n="169" facs="tcp:120106:93"/>walking, idleneſſe, talkativeneſſe,
<note place="margin">2 Theſ. 3.11</note> rudeneſſe in behaviour, as <hi>Levi.</hi> 19.32. not to riſe up before the hoary-head, nor to honour the faces of the Elders; and buſy medling in other mens matters. If a man do evil (as God ſaid to <hi>Cain</hi>) ſinne lyeth at the door,
<note place="margin">Gen. 4.7.</note> to be reproved in him, or puniſhed upon him, if he do not repent and reform.</p>
            <p>Second Rule, Bee ſure the thing wee re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prove in others bee a fault in it ſelf, and alſo a fault in them, or that they are guilty of it. Wee ſhould not go upon meer conjec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures, and ſuſpicions, or bare rumors, and hear-ſayes which are often falſe. Our Savi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>our did not ſo,
<note place="margin">Iſ. 11.2, 3, 4</note> 
               <hi>Hee did not judge after the ſight of his eyes, nor reprove after the hearing of his ears;</hi> that is, not from outward ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pearances or reports, but upon certain know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge, elſe wee do not admoniſh but either miſtake the matter (if it bee not a fault) or we falſly accuſe and ſlander the perſon whom wee reprove, if hee bee not guilty of the fault wee charge upon him. So wee break one commandement (<hi>ſcil.</hi> in bearing falſe witneſſe) to keep another, to wit, that of reproving: and wee may bee juſtly repro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved for reproving unjuſtly,
<note place="margin">Mat. 16.21</note> as <hi>Peter</hi> was by Chriſt, when Chriſt ſhewed to his Diſciples that hee muſt go to <hi>Jeruſalem,</hi> and ſuffer and bee killed; <hi>Then</hi> Peter <hi>took him aſide,
<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="22"/> and began to rebuke him</hi> (<gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>) to chide or charge, as a maſter doth his ſervant (as ſome, underſtand the word) for it, as a fault in him but Chriſt reproved him ſharply for his re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proof, <hi>Get thee behind mee, Satan,

            <p n="3">3 The manner how to reprove, for this I will lay down five Rules.</p>
            <p n="1">1 A reproof muſt be miniſtred in love, pit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, meekneſſe, and reſpect manifeſted to the parties reproved.</p>
            <p n="1">1 In love to their perſons, and deſire of their good,
<note place="margin">Lev. 19.17.</note> yet with diſlike of their fin. <hi>Thou ſhalt not hate thy Brother in thine heart, thou ſhalt in any wiſe rebuke thy Neighbour, and not ſuffer ſin upon him.</hi> Then rebukes muſt not be given in hatred, but in love; They ſhould be uſhered in with prefaces of affection, and en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forced and driven on with evidences of love; For Reproof is a bitter pill, which ſhould be rolled in the Sugar, or lapt up in the pap of love, elſe it will not be eaſily taken, nor go down well. And when we reprehend their faults, its good ſometime to commend their vertues, parts, deſerts, or to intermix the due praiſes of their dear friends, to ſweeten and facilitate their reception of our reproof. A commendation of what is good in others, will inſinuate a reprehenſion of what is evill in them. A reproof as it begins, ſo it ſhould end in love, that the party reproved may not depart diſcontented, but in love with our perſons, and in hatred of his own ſin, being diſmiſſed with an affectionate and friendly farewell.</p>
            <p n="2">2 In pity to their infirmities, ſhew bowels of compaſſion in reproof, that we have a fellow feeling of their weakneſſes, conſidering our ſelves that wee have in us the ſeeds of all ſin,
<note place="margin">Gal. 6.1.</note> and that we have been or may be tempted even as they.</p>

<note place="margin">Jam. 1.20.</note> 
               <hi>for the wrath of man worketh not the Righteouſneſs of God,</hi> by reproof; not in hot blood, or furious zeal, which vents it ſelf in fiery and furious rebukes. Though there muſt be ſome warmth (ſaith a reverend Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine) in a reproof,
<note place="margin">Mr. Whately in his Arche<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>type.</note> yet it muſt not be ſcalding hot. Words of reviling and diſgrace, they ſcald as it were; words that tend to ſtir up the conſcience, to a due conſideration of the evill reprooved, they bee duly warm, and tend to make the Phyſick work more kindly. Nor in an imperious, domineering, provoking, exaſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perating manner, but in a mild winning way, as it were, ſubjecting our ſelves to them, to ſerve them, by reproof. Reproof ſhould come not from an arrogant humor of cenſuring, nor from an ambitious deſire of credit or re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pute, both which are roots of bitterneſs; but from a ſpirit of meekneſſe and lowlineſſe, For meekneſſe qualifies reprehenſion as well as in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruction.

<note n="2" place="margin">Rule.</note> Reproof of a fault in others muſt be ſeconded with arguments (if need require) to ſet it off with evidence, and to ſet it home (to the offenders head and heart) with power.</p>

<note place="margin">Col. 3.16.</note> and that in the word of Chriſt dwelling richly in them. To deliver the words of our admonition out of the word of God, is to draw the evil doer to the light, that his deeds ſhould be reproved; therefore he hates the light and reproof, <hi>Joh.</hi> 3.20. and this is alſo not only to perſwade a man to repent of his fault, and amend, but to command him in the name of the Lord to do it.

<pb n="178" facs="tcp:120106:98"/>prayer. Hereby God is intereſted in it, and it is ſent forth in his name and power. Prayer ingageth Gods preſence in our reproof, and draweth down his bleſſing upon it.

               <hi>Save ſuch with fear,</hi> ſaith <hi>Jude,</hi> that is, terrifie them with ſharp reproofs, pulling them out of the fire. Obſtinate ſinners deſerve bitter and biting Reproofs,
<note place="margin">Mat. 3.7.</note> ſuch as <hi>John</hi> the Baptiſt gave the Phariſees and Sadduces, when hee called them <hi>a generation of Vipers.</hi> And Chriſt the Scribes and hariſees, when he ſaid thus, <hi>yee Serpents,
<note place="margin">Mat. 23.33.</note> yee Generation of <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>ipers, how can yee eſcape the damnation of Heh?</hi>
               <note place="margin">Act. 13.10.</note> And <hi>Paul</hi> gave <hi>Elymas</hi> when he called him, <hi>Thou Child of the Devil, and enemy of all Righteouſneſſe;</hi> yea how ſharply did Chriſt ſometimes reprove his A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſtles?
<note place="margin">Mat. 16 8.</note> 
               <hi>O yee of little faith.</hi> Eſpecially <hi>Peter,</hi> Mat. 16.23. yet if hee bee of ſo fierce and furious a ſpirit, as there may be fear of doing him more hurt than good by reproving him,
<pb n="181" facs="tcp:120106:99"/>or of inraging him againſt us, then we muſt go a more mollifying way to work to win and gain upon him, rather to ſtroak him than to ſtrike him with a reproof, as <hi>Lot</hi> did the <hi>Sodo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mites.</hi> There bee two wayes of reproving.</p>
            <p n="1">1 Directly and plainly to tell others of their faults, as <hi>Nathan</hi> did <hi>David, Thou art the man, &amp;c.</hi> 2 Sam. 12.7, 9, 10.</p>
            <p n="2">2 Indirectly, in a more covert way, by in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>timation or circumlocution. There is great skill in ſhaping reproofs of ſeverall faſhions ſuitable to the ſeveral eſtates, and tempers of the perſons reproveable, and there be ſundry Artifices therein. Eſpecially four, in giving covert reproofs, <hi>ſcil.</hi> by way of obſecration, inſinuation, illuſtration, and exemplification.</p>
            <p n="1">1 Do it by way of obſecration and exhor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation rather than of objurgation, not to childe them expreſly for doing a miſs, but to intreat them not to do ſo (which is an implicit, or an oblique reproof) as <hi>Lot</hi> did the vicious <hi>Sodo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mites,</hi> when they encompaſſed his houſe,
<note place="margin">Gen. 19.5.7.</note> and demanded the men that came in to him, to ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfie their luſt on them; how lovingly did hee intreat them? <hi>I pray you Brethren, do not ſo wickedly.</hi> As when one ſwears, there is not need alway to ſay you do very ill to take Gods Name in vain but, I deſire yea, and nay, may ſerve among Chriſtians.</p>
            <p n="2">2 By way of Inſinuation, to the party to be reproved, thus; I wiſh your good; oh that you would take notice of ſuch a thing you do or ſay, and conſider ſeriouſly with your ſelf, whether you do well therein, or whether it would not bee better to forbear the ſame, or to do otherwiſe.</p>
            <p n="3">
               <pb n="182" facs="tcp:120106:100"/>
3 Of Illuſtration, when wee repreſent the perſon and his fault in the guiſe or ſhape of a compariſon before him, as <hi>Nathan</hi> did <hi>Davids</hi> ſin (of taking the wife of <hi>Vriah</hi>) in the parable of the Ewe-Lamb, whereby hee did covertly and artificially reprove <hi>David,</hi> and cauſed him to judge himſelf in the perſon of another,
<note place="margin">2 Sam. 12.1, 2, 4, 5.</note> to convince him of his ſin, and bring him to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pentance. Thus Chriſt reproved the <hi>Jews</hi> in parables; whereby hee convinced them of their ſins,
<note place="margin">Mat. 21.28. to 33. Verſ. 33. to 36.</note> and made them judge themſelves for the ſame. Two inſtances we find in one Chapter. <hi>ſcil.</hi> of a man that had two ſons, and of a houſholder that let out his Vineyard to Husbandmen.</p>
            <p n="4">4 Of exemplification, when we reprove a mans-fault before his face; but either in a third perſon, as by telling him a ſtory of a man that committed ſuch an offence (as the perſon to be reproved is guilty of) and what a great ble<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſh and diſhonour it was to him, and how ill he was thought and ſpoken of for it; this may ſting him to the heart, and ſet conſcience on work to make the application.</p>
            <p n="2">2 Or in our ſelves,
<note place="margin">Mr Perkins in gove<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>nment of Tongue. C. 6.</note> as though we which reprove were faulty. <hi>Paul</hi> practiſed this in 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 4.6. — <hi>theſe things I have in a figure transferred to my ſelf, and to</hi> Apollo, <hi>for your ſake<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>,</hi> that is, the <hi>Corinthians,</hi> where he ſubſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tutes his Name, and <hi>Apollo's</hi> in the room of the Ambitious Teachers, to reprove arrogance in them. Or when we comprehend our ſelves in the ſame fault, as that wee forget our ſelves, and wee ought not to ſay or do ſo, or thus; ſhould I do ſo (as the perſon to bee reproved
<pb n="183" facs="tcp:120106:100"/>hath done) I ſhould tranſgreſſe greatly, and deſerve blame and ſhame for it. I ſhould humble and judge my ſelf for it.</p>
            <p>The Second branch of the fifth Rule is, we ſhould ſuit our Reproof to the nature of the Offence, under a fivefold conſideration, <hi>ſcil.</hi> according as it is</p>
            <p n="1">1 Open or ſecret, publick or private, ſo ſhould the Reproof be. Open ſins deſerve open rebuke, <hi>Thoſe that ſin</hi> openly to the ſcandall of the Church, <hi>rebuke before all,
<note place="margin">1 Tim. 5.20. Gal. 2.14.</note> that others alſo may fear. Paul</hi> rebuked <hi>Peter</hi> (not ſecretly, but) before them all, becauſe he ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned openly and ſcandalouſly, and by his exam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple induced <hi>Barnabas</hi> and others to diſſemble. But private monition will ſerve for private faults, elſe in labouring to heal our Brothers conſcience, wee may wound his name. <hi>Our Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viour gives this Rule,</hi> in <hi>Mat.</hi> 18.15. <hi>If thy Brother treſpaſs againſt thee, go and tell him his faults between thee and him alone, then take with thee but one or two more.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="2">2 As the Offence is great, or ſmall, ſo ſhould the Reproof bee ſharper or milder; wee ſhould deal with others faults, as wee do with our own ſores or ſwellings, if the prick of a pin will let out the corrupt matter, cutting or lancing ſhall not be uſed; wee muſt not deal with beams as with moats. Chriſt heightned and ſharpened his Reproofs of <hi>Peter,</hi> and <hi>Paul</hi> his of <hi>Elymas,</hi> according to the greatneſſe of their faults. Old <hi>Ely</hi> offended greatly in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proving his leud ſons too lightly. Reproofs ſhould bee commenſurate to the offence; yet wee muſt not aggravate it beyond what may
<pb n="184" facs="tcp:120106:101"/>draw the ſinner to repentance, leſt wee ſhould drive him to deſpair.
<note place="margin">Tit. 1.13.</note> 
               <hi>Paul</hi> bids <hi>Titus</hi> rebuke the Judaizing Cretians ſharply, <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>, cut<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tingly, that they may be ſound in the Faith.</p>
            <p n="3">3 As the fault is committed out of weak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs or wilfullneſs,
<note place="margin">Gal. 6.1.</note> of ignorance, or of know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge; the former wee ſhould reprove in a ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit of meekneſs, as tenderly as Chirurgeons ſet arms and legs in joynt, with ſo ſoft a hand that the patient can ſcarce feel when the bone falls in again, we ſhould ſhew much compaſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion and fellow-feeling in dealing with ſuch; and great tenderneſs to ſet them in joynt a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gain. The latter wee ſhould reprove with a ſpirit of Zeal, Power and Boldneſs, like ſons of thunder.</p>
            <p n="4">4 As it is a fault but once or ſeldome com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted, or frequently; as it is newly fallen into, or long continued in; Reproof with a ſtill voice will ſuit and ſerve for the former, but it muſt bee louder and ſharper, more awaken<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing and peircing for the latter; wee ſhould lift up our voice as a Trumpet to tell ſuch of their ſins.</p>
            <p n="5">5 As this is the firſt time the party was re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proved for the fault;
<note place="margin">Prov. 29.1.</note> or hee hath often been reproved, yet hardeneth himſelf; ſuch an one is a knotty peece, there is need to take the hard Mall and ſharp wedges of Reproof to rive him. Thus the quality and quan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tity or degrees of ſin muſt be well conſidered, and Reproof muſt bee accommodated and proportioned thereunto; By reproving amiſs in the manner wee may commit as great an error, as the fault is which wee reprove.</p>
            <p n="4">
               <pb n="185" facs="tcp:120106:101"/>
4 The Seaſon when wee ſhould reprove. It is difficult to give any certain Rules for that, becauſe of variety of circumſtances which may alter the caſe as to the time; wiſdome muſt direct herein. Yet I ſhall give two Rules.</p>
            <p n="1">1 It is good to reprove an offender as ſoon after the fault is committed, as may be conve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niently, as it is to apply a plaiſter as ſoon as the ſore breaks forth, or the wound is made; whilſt the fault is freſh in remembrance; becauſe the conſcience is then uſually moſt ſtirring, and apt to bee convinced, and ſet on work to ſmite the offender, and he is more inclinable to be made ſenſible of his fault, and to hearken to Reproof, who by the delay thereof may mul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiply his ſin, and contract a habit of it.
<note place="margin">Heb. 3.13.</note>—As we ſhould exhort, ſo reprove one another daily while it is called to day, leſt our Brother bee hardened through the deceitfulneſs of ſin. Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proof ſhould follow ſin at the heels, yet in two caſes wee may deferre a Reproof for a time.</p>
            <p n="1">1 To get the offending Brother alone, and ſo a fitter opportunity to do it.</p>
            <p n="2">2 Till our blood bee cool, and Paſſions calm'd.</p>
            <p n="2">2 Its a Seaſon for Reproof, when the of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fender is in a capacity to receive the Impreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion thereof, or to bee wrought upon thereby, — as</p>
            <p n="1">1 When hee is himſelf, and not diſtempe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red either with drink, <hi>Abigail</hi> deferred to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prove <hi>Nabal,
<note place="margin">1 Sam. 25.36, 37. Pro. 18.19.</note> till hee had ſlept out his wine</hi>—or with paſſion, <hi>A Brother offended</hi> (that is, pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>voked to paſſion) <hi>is harder to bee won</hi> (even by
<pb n="186" facs="tcp:120106:102"/>reproof) <hi>than a ſtrong City.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="2">2 When hee is more than himſelf, or bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter than his ordinary, and uſuall ſelf <hi>(ſcil.)</hi> in a humble, tender, melting or malleable frame.</p>
            <p>It is good ſtriking while the Iron is hot. Then deal with thy deareſt friend when hee hath an open ear, a teachable and tractable Spirit, as men ſometimes, and more uſually have, when the hand of God is upon them in ſickneſſe, or ſome other affliction, as <hi>Job</hi> 33.22, 23. <hi>Pſal.</hi> 141.6. — But of this I ſpake be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore in the ſeaſons of ſpeech. — The opportuni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty of time, and place, greatly advantageth the prevalency of Reproof. <hi>Abigail</hi> ſhewed her prudence in apprehending the ſame.</p>
            <p n="3">3 When hee is Reproached by others for his faults, and is troubled and vexed at them, and it may bee made worſe than hee is by o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers raylings, and revilings. — Then wee ſhould ſtrike in with a pertinent and pithy re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proof, to heal his infirmity to the bottom, and his credit to the top; and by wiſe applicati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on and friendly admonition to make an An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tidote of the poyſon of others bitter ſpeeches againſt him, to preſerve him from the Infe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction of thoſe ſins to which hee is ſubject, and to expel the venome thereof.</p>
            <p n="4">4 Its not a Seaſon to reprove others as ſoon as they have reproved us, leſt it ſhould ſavour of diſdain in us to bear Reproof, or of malice to revenge it, by returning <hi>quid pro quo,</hi> like for like, as it were bite for bite, or ſcrat for ſcrat, becauſe wee would have them to be no better than wee, but both to lye under the
<pb n="187" facs="tcp:120106:102"/>ſame guilt — Such a retorting of Reproof doth not heal, but hurt both the parties, <hi>ſcil.</hi> the Reprover, and the Reproved. — There<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore firſt take a Reproof kindly from another, and digeſt it well; afterwards give him a gentle Reproof (as there is occaſion) and hereby thou may both ſet him a Pattern, and lay an ingagement upon him to take a Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proof well from thee.</p>
            <p>The Third thing follows, <hi>ſcil.</hi> Reaſons of it, which may bee drawn from the Neceſſity, Commodity, and Excellency of Reproof.</p>
            <p n="1">1 From the Neceſſity of it in it ſelf,
<note place="margin">Neceſſity.</note> for both the Law and the Goſpel command it, <hi>Levit.</hi> 19 17. <hi>Mat.</hi> 18.15. and that in reſpect

                  <item>2 Of others.—</item>
               </list>
            </p>
            <p n="1">1 In reſpect of our ſelves, its needfull for us to reprove others that offend.</p>
            <p n="1">1 To bear witneſſe againſt ſin in others, and not to contract the guilt or ſoil of it to our ſelves. — <hi>Thou ſhalt not hate thy Brother in thine heart, rebuking thou ſhalt rebuke him, that thou bear not ſin for him,</hi> i. e. guilt and puniſhment for his ſake, for not reproving him. — To leave others in their ſins unrepro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved, is to be partakers of other mens ſins,
<note place="margin">Qui non verat peccare, cum poſſit, jubet. Epheſ. 5.</note> which wee ſhould not bee by our ſilence, no more than draw others into ſin by our ſpeech. — <hi>Have no fellowſhip</hi> (ſaith <hi>Paul</hi>) <hi>with the unfruit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full works of darkneſſe, but rather reprove them.</hi> — The evils wee reprove in others cannot cleave to us, nor bee charged upon us; but hereby wee keep our ſelves free and fair from the Taint, ſpot, and attainder of them.</p>
            <p n="2">
               <pb n="188" facs="tcp:120106:103"/>
2 To diſcharge our ſelves from the blood of others ſouls, which God may require at our hands for ſuffering ſin upon them unre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>buked. — That threat in <hi>Ezek.</hi> 3.18. lyes, though mainly againſt the Miniſter, yet not only, but againſt private perſons who neglect their duty therein. — <hi>If thou ſpeakeſt not to warn the wicked from his wicked way, to ſave his life, hee ſhall dye in his iniquity, but his blood will I require at thine hand.</hi> The ruin of others will bee imputed to us, if they periſh through want of our admonition.</p>
            <p>This Menace ſhould ſet home the duty of Reproof,
<note place="margin">Act. 20.26.</note> and the danger of neglect, to our hearts, — <hi>Paul</hi> could not ſay — <hi>I am pure from the blood of all men,</hi> If he had not been a faith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full Reprover, as well as a diligent Inſtructor.</p>
            <p n="2">2 Reproof is needfull in reſpect of others, either that offend or that ſtand by.</p>
            <p n="1">1 Of them that offend.</p>
            <p n="1">1 To ſave them from ſin, death and Hell. <hi>Hee who</hi> (by wiſe Reproof) <hi>converteth the ſinner from the Errour of his way, ſhall ſave a ſoul from death, and ſhall hide a multitude of ſins,</hi> Jam. 5.20. — Reproof is Gods Phy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſick, as needfull for the cure of ſouls, as pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ging, or letting of blood, or plaiſters are for mens bodies. Reproof is Gods ordinance to pull a ſoul out of the fire of ſin, and Hell, which elſe would bee burnt (or rather be bur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning) everlaſtingly — out of a pit of corrup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, which without ſuch a hand of Reproof reached forth to recover him, would ſink and bee drowned — to ſave a ſoul, that elſe may periſh, — to gain a ſoul to God, and godli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe,
<pb n="189" facs="tcp:120106:103"/>to his Truths, and wayes, and to our ſelves in true affection, that is in danger to be loſt. — <hi>Tell thy Brother</hi> (ſaith Chriſt) <hi>between thee and him alone — If hee ſhall hear thee, thou haſt gained thy Brother,</hi> Mat. 18.15. — Now to gain or ſave a ſoul is a more worthy work than to win or ſave a World, becauſe one ſoul is more worth than a World — If there be need of lifting up a Brothers,
<note place="margin">Deut. 22.4. Exod. 23.5.</note> yea enemies Oxe, or Aſſe that is fallen, or lyeth under his burden — <hi>Thou ſhalt ſurely help him up,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Verſ. 4.</note> — or bringing it back when it goeth aſtray, — Is there not great need of reſtoring, and redu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cing a Brother when hee is faln or wanders? and of Reproof as a means thereof? ſhould wee take pity and care of a Neighbours Oxe, and Aſſe, and not of his ſoul?</p>
            <p n="2">2 Reproof is needfull to keep back the great Judgement from them, to wit, of not being reproved. As it is a great mercy of God to ſend his ſervants to reprove us for our faults; and not ſuffer ſin to lye upon us, nor us to lye in it; and for us to carry us ſo, as no Righteous perſon may be afraid, or unwilling to tell us of what they ſee amiſs in us: So it is a grievous Judgement for God to take away Reprovers from a Nation, or a perſon; for God to give over reproving of men by his Servants, or to forbid them to do it; It is a ſign hee hath a purpoſe to deſtroy them. — When God threatens to plague <hi>Judah</hi> for their Rebellion, and utterly to caſt them off,
<note place="margin">Ezek. 3.26.</note> hee impoſeth ſilence upon the Prophet <hi>Ezekiel,</hi> as a heavy Judgement to them; ſo as he ſhould reprove their miſcarriage no more — <hi>I will
<pb n="190" facs="tcp:120106:104"/>make thy Tongue cleave to the roof of thy mouth? that thou ſhalt be dumb, and ſhalt not bee to them a Reprover; for they are a Rebellious houſe. — E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phraim</hi> was in a deſperate ſtate, when God gave forth that Prohibition — <hi>Let no man re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prove another,
<note place="margin">Hoſ. 4.4.</note> for this people are as they that ſtrive with the Prieſt,</hi> that is, will endure no Reprover. — Therefore, ſaith God, <hi>Let them alone,</hi> If they will ſin, let them; if they will go on in their wickedneſſe, and ſo deſtroy themſelves, let them, I will contend no longer with them by Reproofs. — This is the high way to Hell, yea to go poſte to the Devil without ſtop, or let, or any turn; when God forbids others to reprove us; that wee may go on to fill up the meaſure of our Iniquity; and run to the pit of Hell, and no body ſtay us. — Then God paſſeth that hardening ſin-ſea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling ſentence upon men,
<note place="margin">Rev. 22.11.</note> — <hi>Hee that is unjuſt, let him bee unjuſt ſtill</hi> (and never amend) <hi>hee that is filthy, let him be filthy ſtill,</hi> and never bee made clean; when hee takes away Reproof from them, which might have been a means of their amending, and cleanſing. — Then it is no priviledge to any man not to be reproved for his faults, no more than it was to <hi>Cain</hi> not to bee killed, to live a miſerable life (worſe than death) to bee a ſpectacle of Gods wrath, and judgement. — To want Reproof is a fearfull judgement from God, and a lamentable ſtate of man. Is not then Reproof needfull?</p>
            <p n="2">2 As in reſpect of the Offenders, ſo of by<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanders or of others, that ſee and hear of their offence, that they may take warning by their Reproofs, not to do the like, as they would
<pb n="191" facs="tcp:120106:104"/>avoid the blame, and ſhame thereof. — Them that ſin (to wit ſcandalouſly, and openly) re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>buke before all, that others alſo may fear, ſaith <hi>Paul,</hi> 1 Tim. 5.20. that is, be awed thereby, and kept from falling into the like ſins. — By a publick Reproof many may receive Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fit, and much evil may bee prevented there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by to others, as well as advantages may come to the offenders themſelves.

               <hi>Open rebuke is better than ſecret love,</hi> Prov. 27.5. or an open reproving love is to be pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferred before a ſecret ſilent love; for the for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer delivers a Brother from ſin, and Satan, and the latter delivers him up to both. The former is fruitfull, the latter barren; — Love without rebuke when our Brothers caſe re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quires it, is like a Bow without an Arrow to ſhoot in it, like a knife without an edge to cut, a hand without a plaiſter to heal, or like a Bee without a ſting, a drone, or ſlug, good for nothing. —</p>
            <p n="3">3 <hi>David</hi> calls Reproof a <hi>precious Oyl,</hi> Pſal. 141.5.

            <p n="1">1 Ignorance and folly, wee know not how to do it aright.</p>

            <p n="2">2 How to order a Reproof; and ſet in edgewiſe, to convince the judgement and Conſcience of the offender concerning his Treſpaſſe: and what it is to reprove, and what to reproach an offender, whereby hee is rather hardened in his wickedneſs, and made worſe, then better.</p>
            <p n="3">3 How to deal with men of ſeveral ſpirits, and Tempers, and how to frame and faſhion reproof to the ſeveral kinds, and degrees of ſin.</p>
            <p>The Art of reproving is like the Husband<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mans skil, which his God doth teach him,
<note place="margin">Iſ. 28.26, 27, 28</note> in reſpect of ſeveral grains, as to beat out Cum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>min, and fitches, with a ſtaffe or little rod; and to bruiſe out the bread-corn, as wheat, and Rie, by the force of the flail, or Cart wheel. So God doth teach the ſpiritual man whom to touch with a Twig of reproof; whom to ſmite with a rod, and whom to threſh with a flail of reproof. Not to over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>charge others with reproof; and to this end to conſider not ſo much, what hee is able to ſpeak, as what others are able to bear; leaſt if his Reproofs be too harſh ſharp, or bitter for them, they cannot digeſt, or keep them, but preſently caſt them up again as weak ſto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>macks do phyſick that is too ſtrong for them.</p>

               <hi>Anſw.</hi> 1. The Duty of Reproof (ſaith Doctor <hi>Ames,</hi> pertains in ſome ſort to all
<pb n="199" facs="tcp:120106:108"/>men, who have the uſe of Reaſon by a natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral precept. It is a work of charity and a gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral Office of Neighbour to Neighbour. Hence Beleevers may reprove Infidels, and Infidels may reprove Beleevers, as I ſhewed before. Though (as hee ſaith) the duty lyes eſpecially upon them, who in regard of office are bound to take charge of others: or are fit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter in regard of parts to perform the ſame with good ſucceſſe.</p>
            <p n="2">2 Though Miniſters muſt admoniſh of au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority, or by office, yet all others may and ought to admoniſh of brotherly charity. E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very private Chriſtian (as one ſaith) may bear the perſon, though not the office of a Repro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver. — Though hee hath not authority over another, yet hee hath this duty incumbent upon himſelf to reprove his brother, or neigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour when he offends.</p>
            <p>The ſecond Duty is to take Reproof, well. Indeed our firſt care ſhould bee not to deſerve it, but <hi>to bee blameleſs, and harmeleſs,

To this end take no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tice 1 Of our Averſeneſſe to it. 2 The manner 3 Matter of it. 4 Motives to it.</p>

Hence when wee reprove others, they will re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tort it upon us, and recriminate, or ſeek occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion to reprove, or reproach us; or if they have known any thing amiſs in us, though twenty years ago, which God and man have pardoned, and is healed, they will revive it to our diſgrace, or tell us in the generall that we

<note place="margin">Joh. 9.34.</note> and they caſt him out,</hi> and wee are apt to do the like to others, when they reprove us.— Now conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der the cauſes of our backwardneſſe to bear re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proof, which are great Impediments of our taking it well. Eſpecially four,</p>
            <p n="1">1 Prejudicate opinions harboured in our boſomes of thoſe that reprove us, as</p>
            <p n="1">1 That they are proud, and uſurp authori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty over us as our Judges or Lords, and would ſeem better, and holier than wee; as <hi>Korah</hi> and his company ſaid to <hi>Moſes</hi> and <hi>Aaron</hi> (the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>provers of <hi>Iſrael</hi>) <hi>yee take too much upon you,
<note place="margin">Numb 16.3.</note> ſeeing all the Congregation are holy, and the Lord is among them.</hi> — As the <hi>Sodomites</hi> ſaid to <hi>Lot,
<note place="margin">Gen. 19 9.</note> This one fellow came in to ſojourn, and hee will needs bee a judge.</hi>— When <hi>Moſes</hi> midly ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moniſhed the Hebrew that ſmote his fellow, he ſaid, <hi>who made thee a Prince,
<note place="margin">Exod. 2.13.14.</note> and a Judge o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver us? intendeſt thou to kill mee, as thou kil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledſt that Egyptian?</hi>— When the Prophet re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proved <hi>Amaziah</hi> King of <hi>Judah</hi> for his Idola<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try, preſently the King reproved the Prophet with a ſcoff, <hi>Art thou made of the Kings Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſell? forbear, why ſhouldeſt thou bee ſmitten?</hi> q. d. wilt thou meddle with ſtate affairs? 2 <hi>Chron.</hi> 25.26.</p>
            <p n="2">2 Or that they hate us, and tell us of our faults out of malice, or ill-will to caſt diſgrace upon us. We are apt to count Reprovers our enemies, as <hi>Ahab</hi> did <hi>Elijah,
<note place="margin">1 King. 21.20.</note> Haſt thou found mee, O mine enemy?</hi> and the <hi>Galathians</hi> did <hi>Paul</hi> for reproving their backſliding; <hi>Am I there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
<pb n="202" facs="tcp:120106:110"/>become your enemy, becauſe I tell you the Truth?</hi> Gal. 4.16. — Theſe Jealouſies and pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>judices ſhould bee plucked up by the roots, elſe they will imbitter Reproofs to us; though they bee milde, and ſweet, and they will imbitter our ſpirits againſt our Repro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers, though they bee loving and faithfull to us.</p>
            <p>The ſecond Cauſe is Pride of heart, ſelf-love, and ſelf conceit, that wee think our ſelves as good as others, not inferiour (whereas the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proved is ſome way under the Reprover) and therefore we take it ill to be told of our faults; Wee would have a <hi>Noli me tangere,</hi> written upon us, that none may come neer us to touch us with a Reproof.—Man is a croſs Creature, and cannot abide to be checked or control<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led.</p>
            <p>The Third Cauſe is too much love, or li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king of ſin (eſpecially a Delilah) or loathneſs to part with it (as with a right eye) or to have it touched.</p>
            <p>The fourth is unwillingneſs to bear ſhame, and grief for ſin, that makes us unwilling to bear Reproof for ſin. — The removing of theſe Impediments will make way for receiving admonition with much fruit and comfort.</p>
            <p n="2">2 Conſider the right manner of bearing Reproof, for the modality of an act hath a great Influence into the Efficacy and ſucceſs thereof. To take Reproof well, will make it work well, as Phyſick doth. But to take Reproof wrong, is like the taking of a dagger or knife by the wrong end, <hi>ſcil.</hi> by the point, or edge, and not by the heft, then it may do
<pb n="203" facs="tcp:120106:110"/>us more hurt than good. — We ſhould receive Reproof,

            </p>
            <p n="1">1 Humbly, even condeſcend, and ſtoop low to take an Admonition even from an in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feriour or mean perſon,

            <p n="3">3 The means of taking Reproof well, are three, which wee ſhould labour for.</p>
            <p n="1">1 A wiſe heart to underſtand the nature, and end, the uſe, and benefit of reproof, that it is an effect of mercy, and means of grace, and of much good from God to us; an argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment

            <p n="2">2 An obedient ear,
<note place="margin">Prov. 25.12.</note> to hearken to reproof as Gods ordinance; to receive Admonition, and Inſtruction, as to what God ſpeaks to us by them that reprove us.</p>
            <p n="3">3 A tractable ſpirit, to comply with a re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proof, as ſoft wax with the ſeal; to receive a full and deep impreſſion of it: to apply it cloſe as a plaiſter to the ſore, to heal our manners; to yeeld our ſelves freely to it, as mettal hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted to the hammer, or melted to the mould, to bee new wrought, or new caſt; to ſubmit to a rod of Admonition, as meekly as a child doth to a rod of correction; to bee drawn from evil to good, from vice to vertue, as effectually by a coard of reprehenſion, as wee can bee forci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly by a cable of compulſion. To give up our ſelves as ſervants to Admonition, to obey it, is the way to become Maſters over our ſelves, to have rule over our own ſpirits, and to com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand our corruptions.</p>
            <p n="4">4 Is Motives to this duty, from two heads,

            </p>
            <p n="1">1 It is a ſign of a gracious heart to take re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proof well, as <hi>David</hi> did from the Prophet <hi>Nathan,</hi> hee affected and reſpected him more for his plain, and home-reproof of him, <hi>Thou art the man,</hi> than before. Hee had liberty of acceſſe into King <hi>Davids</hi> preſence, who com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>municated to him the ſecret, and weighty af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fairs of his Kingdome, 1 <hi>King.</hi> 1.23, 27. and afterwards from the Prophet <hi>Gad, Davids</hi>
               <pb n="205" facs="tcp:120106:111"/>Seer, 2 <hi>Sam.</hi> 24.11. to 15. to whoſe Admo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nition with a Kallender of judgements annexed to it, — for <hi>Davids</hi> ſin in numbring the people, <hi>David</hi> hearkened with meekneſſe and ſubmiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion. Yea <hi>David</hi> took a blow of reproof well, not only from Gods Prophets, but from any righteous man, even as head-Oyl,
<note place="margin">Pſal. 141.5.</note> a heart-kindneſſe; though reproof bee a dry morſel, yet hee could relliſh it, and digeſt it well: yea from a woman, as <hi>Abigail,</hi> whoſe wiſe reproof hee embraced with all thankfullneſſe to God, and her, and took her afterward to be his wife, 1 <hi>Sam.</hi> 25.32, 33, 34. If you would be <hi>Da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vid</hi> like, men after Gods own heart, then write after his Coppy, take reproof well whoſoever gives it. You may read in the life of <hi>John Ger<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſin,</hi> Chancellour of <hi>Paris,</hi> that he rejoyced in nothing more, <hi>quamſi ab aliquo fraterne, &amp; ut ait, Charitative redargueretur,</hi> than to be bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therly and lovingly reproved by any. Though <hi>Paul</hi> reproved <hi>Peter</hi> ſharply, and recorded his reproof, yet <hi>Peter</hi> took it well, elſe he would not have commended <hi>Paul,</hi> and his Epiſtles afterwards, 2 <hi>Pet.</hi> 3.15, 16. — Chriſt as a ſtranger reproved the two Diſciples, going to <hi>Emmaus</hi> for their folly and unbeleef, yet they conſtrained him by intreaty, to come in, and eat with them, <hi>Luk.</hi> 24.25, 29, 30.</p>
            <p n="2">2 To take reproof well, is, and will bee</p>

<pb n="206" facs="tcp:120106:112"/>with other wiſe men in Gods houſhold.</p>
            <p n="2">2 Our Profit, for great is the benefit, and bleſſing of reproof (as hath been declared) and to receive it readily, is the means to reap it wholly.</p>
            <p n="3">3 Our comfort, that reproofs have been healing medicines to us, as <hi>Abigail</hi> ſaid to <hi>Da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vid,</hi> 1 <hi>Sam.</hi> 25.30, 31. when the Lord hath done to us according to all the good hee hath promiſed us; then it will bee no grief unto us, nor offence of heart, that wee have hearkened to counſel, and been reformed by reproof.</p>
            <p n="4">4 Our honour; <hi>For hee that regardeth Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proof ſhall bee honoured,

            <p>Object. <hi>How can I bear Reproof well, ſeeing it wounds, and cuts mee to the heart?</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Anſ.</hi> 1 Reproofs are but <hi>the wounds of a friend which are faithfull</hi> (or <hi>nutrienda,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Prov. 27.6.</note> as ſome think the word ſignifieth, to be nouriſhed and received with thankfulneſſe) even deep peir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cing reproofs; <hi>but the kiſſes</hi> (<hi>i. e.</hi> fawnings and flatterings) <hi>of an enemy are deceitfull,</hi> or <hi>depre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>canda,</hi> as <hi>Junius</hi> renders it, to be prayed againſt.</p>
            <p n="2">2 The wounds of a faithfull reproof are but like the wounds which a Surgeon makes when hee cuts the fleſh to cure the ſore; not like the wounds of an enemy which tend to kill and deſtroy. — To have thy ſin diſcovered, and thy heart pricked with grief for it, by
<pb n="207" facs="tcp:120106:112"/>the point of a reproof, is the way to have thy ſoul healed of ſinne, and ſaved from hell, whereas to think thy ſelf ſo whole, as not to need the Phyſick of reproof, may prove a Corraſive to thy Conſcience, and a ſtab to thy heart another day.</p>
            <p>Second Motive; Conſider the evil of reje<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cting reproof, both the evil of ſin, and of pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhment.</p>
            <p n="1">1 The evil of ſin that is in it, which ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pears in ſix particulars.</p>
            <p n="1">1 Not to bear reproof is a fault in a King, (who if any perſon, might think himſelf to be above reproof, and exempted from the laſh thereof) much more in an inferior. <hi>Better is a poor,
<note place="margin">Eccl. 4.13.</note> and wiſe Child</hi> (ſaith the Preacher) to wit, who will receive reproof, and correction, <hi>than an old and fooliſh King who will no more be admoniſhed,</hi> or who knows not to bee admoniſhed as yet, that is, to take it well. For he that is paſt reproof for his faults, is paſt hope of amendment. It is the Charac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter of a ſelf-conceited and wilful man, to bee ſo wedded and wedged to his opinion, or way, as that he cannot indure any mans advice, or reproof.</p>
            <p n="2">2 It is folly; for hee is a fooliſh King (though a King, and old) who will not indure to bee admoniſhed. Untractableneſſe of heart againſt Reproof, is a fruit and ſign of folly. For Reproof is an inſtructive and cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rective of wiſdome. It is folly and mad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe to ſtorme and rage againſt it, and not to juſtifie the Lord in what is ſpoken againſt our ſins, or againſt us for them. If wee will not
<pb n="208" facs="tcp:120106:113"/>bear verbal Reproofs, how can wee bear real blows or ſtripes when wee are buffeted for our faults,
<note place="margin">1 Pet. 2.20</note> Is it not great folly in us wilful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly to deprive our ſelves of the means of our good, or of good by the means? To caſt off re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proofs, is to caſt up meat as ſoon as wee have eaten it, how can it nouriſh us, or phyſick as ſoon as wee have taken it, how can it purge us? or to pull off a plaiſter as ſoon as it is laid on, how can it heal us?</p>
            <p n="3">3 It is bruitiſhneſſe. <hi>Hee that hateth re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proof is bruitiſh,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Prov. 12.1</note> ſaith <hi>Solomon,</hi> hee is a beaſt, hee hath not the underſtanding of a man. He is like a dog that barks, and bites, when his maſter takes a Thorn or prick out of his foot, or like a horſe that kicks and ſtrikes, when the Oſtler doth but rub the dirt, and mire off him, or when the Rider ſpurs him for his ſlowneſs, or ſtumbling Thou haſt no more underſtanding than an Oxe or Aſſe that lifts up thy heel, or opens thy mouth to find fault with him that reproves thee friendly and faithfully for thy ſins; thou art a beaſt in mans ſhape that chuſeth to live in ſuch families, and ſocieties, where all things are lawfull, or where there is li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berty for every one to live as he liſt, and do what ſeems good in his own eyes, and no man is to reprove another, or ſay, ill thou doſt — Is not this to live like a Beaſt, or in a herd among beaſts? Such have cauſe to judge and humble themſelves before the Lord, and ſay with the Pſalmiſt <hi>So fooliſh was I, and ignorant, I was as a beaſt before thee? — Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bals</hi> ſervant accuſed his maſter of folly,
<note place="margin">Pſal. 73.22</note> and
<pb n="209" facs="tcp:120106:113"/>bruitiſh ſtupidity, that he would indure no body to admoniſh him of his ſinne, or dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger, hee was ſo harſh, and churliſh, and had not the patience to bear it.
<note place="margin">1 Sam. 25.17</note> — <hi>Hee is ſuch a Sonne of Belial, that a man cannot ſpeak to him.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="4">4 The refuſal of reproof is the way to mul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiply ſin, to perſiſt in ſin, to live and dye in ſin. Becauſe reproof is a remedy of Gods appoint<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment againſt ſin, to give a ſtop to it, or put in a bar againſt it. Now the refuſal of reproof is a removal of this let, or impediment and opens a door to let in all iniquity. <hi>How have I hated in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruction,</hi> will he that hath been enticed to whoredome, at laſt mourn and ſay? <hi>&amp; my heart deſpiſed reproof;
<note place="margin">Pro. 5.11. to 15</note> and have not obeyed the voice of my Teachers, &amp;c. I was almoſt in all evil, in the midſt of the Congregation and aſſembly,</hi> which words may bee underſtood as expreſſing the greatneſſe of his ſinne (<hi>q.d.</hi> there is almoſt no ſin, which I did not commit, without ſhame or bluſhing, openly in the ſight of others) as well as the greatneſſe of his miſery, q. d. I am made a publike ſpectacle of ruine for all men to gaze at. To reject reproof is the way to go aſtray, do amiſſe, and to go on in iniqui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, without ſtop or let, and not to return, nor reform, to fall and lye in ſinne, and not to recover, nor riſe again; to bee hardned and rooted in evil, to bee lull'd aſleep in the Cradle of ſecurity, and ſetled on our Lees, without means, or hope of being removed, tranſplanted, and awakened,
<note place="margin">Prov. 10.17</note> 
               <hi>Hee is in the way of life,</hi> ſaith the wiſe man; <hi>that keepeth inſtruction or admonition,</hi> that holds it
<pb n="210" facs="tcp:120106:114"/>faſt, and makes uſe of it; <hi>but hee that refu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeth eproof erreth,</hi> that is, hee not onely is out of his way, but without help, or hope to ſet him right, or bring him into it again, which reproof would do. There is no end of erring to him who refuſeth to bee reproved; for hee cauſeth to erre (as the word may bee rendred) or wilfully makes himſelf to goe out of the way, and keep out, and not come in again, whereas Reproof would re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duce him.</p>
            <p n="5">5 The rejection of reproof is a great aggra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation of ſin, an adding of ſin to ſin, God urged this againſt <hi>Iſrael,</hi> to make their ſinne out of meaſure ſinfull, that he had rebuked them by his Prophets, &amp; laboured their reformation <hi>The Revolters are profound to make ſlaughter,

            <p n="2">2 Conſider the evil of puniſhment that
<pb n="211" facs="tcp:120106:114"/>accompanieth it. Rejecting of reproof is the way to calamity without pitty, and to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruction without remedy. — It is (as one calls it) an expreſſe and explicit ſign of ever<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>laſting ruine to deſpiſe reproof. — When King <hi>Amaziah</hi> taunted Gods Prophet, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe hee reproved him for ſeeking after the Gods of <hi>Edom;</hi> then the Prophet ſaid — <hi>I know that God hath determined to deſtroy thee; becauſe thou haſt done this, and haſt not heark<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned to my Counſell,</hi> or reproof.

            <p>How doth wiſdome complain, and threat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>en the contemners of her reproofs, <hi>Prov.</hi> 1.24. to 33. <hi>Hee that hates reproof ſhall dye,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Prov. 15.10</note> ſaith <hi>Solomon;</hi> is in danger to bee ſurprized with ſome ſudden, dreadfull judgement, or ſhame<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full miſerable end. Hell gapes for ſuch, and earth groans under them.
<note place="margin">Deur. 17.12</note> The Law of <hi>Moſes</hi> appoints that the man that will do preſump<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuouſly, and not hearken to reprovers, to wit, the Prieſt and the judge, that man ſhall dye. Some think <hi>Solomon</hi> hath reference thereunto: hee that hates reproof ſhall dye becauſe that is the high way to do preſump<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuouſly. A <hi>Man of reproofs,</hi> that is,

In company improve the time for profitable, ediſying diſcourſe, there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by waving ſinfull, worldly, or vain talk, cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rupt communication; let us redeem time, for ſo beneficiall a buſineſſe, to drive ſo thriving a trade, remembring how much precious time wee have formerly ſquandred away in worth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſſe, fooliſh frothy ſpeech. The leaſt minute of time, is too good to ſpend in ſpeaking an idle word.</p>
            <p>The Second Rule. Obſerve the diſpoſiti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, tentations, afflictions, and conditions of the perſons preſent, to ſuit and apply your diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courſe to their neceſſities and capacities.</p>
            <p n="1">1 To their neceſſities, as to inſtruct the ig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>norant, comfort the feeble-minded, and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vince gainſayers, ſupport the weak, quicken the dull, awaken the drouſie, to counſel them that are in doubt, to confirm them that ſtag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger, and reduce ſuch as wander. Conference is a bow in which wee may ſhoot all ſorts of arrows (as leſſons, comforts, checks, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proofs, reſtraints, excitements, incourage<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments) with force and vigour, and take aim aright to hit the party (and that part of him (whether his head, heart, or hand) which wee intend, and make our ſpeech come home to his boſome, and ſtick upon his ſpirit, with
<pb n="215" facs="tcp:120106:116"/>good ſucceſſe. One ſaith, <hi>Speech of touch to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward others ſhould bee ſparingly uſed,
<note place="margin">Sir Francis Ba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cons Eſſayes.</note> for diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courſe ought to bee as a field, without comming home to any man.</hi> I conceive if ſpeech do not touch, it will not take, if not applyed home to the party, it will not work ſo effectually.</p>
            <p n="2">2 To their capacities, who are dull and ſlow of apprehenſion; wee ſhould ſtoop to the underſtanding of the meaneſt, which is to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diſcend to them of low eſtate and parts,
<note place="margin">Rom. 12.16.</note> and to put milk into the mouthes of babes; that is as neceſſary as to ſet meat before ſtrong men? to impart ſpiritual gifts to them, as the rich give alms to the poor. Chriſt accommo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dated his diſcourſe to the capacity of his hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rers, <hi>as they were able to hear it.</hi>
               <note place="margin">Mar. 4.33.</note>
            </p>
            <p>The Third Rule. Raiſe ſpiritual diſcourſe from temporal occaſions, either then pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent, or ſpoken of, whether creatures, or oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>currences, either by way</p>
            <p n="1">1 Of Alluſion, or reference, thus, As food cannot nouriſh, nor cloaths keep warm the bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy, except eaten and put on; no more can Chriſt, unleſſe applyed to the ſoul. As phy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſick cannot heal the body if not taken, no more can the means of grace, cure the ſoul if not uſed; and the like.</p>
            <p n="2">2 Of Concluſion, or inference from what is ſaid or done.
<note place="margin">Luk. 14.7. to 12.</note> Chriſt took occaſion from the ambition hee obſerved in the bidden Gueſts, to teach them humility <hi>in chuſing roomes,</hi> ſcil. <hi>to ſit down in the loweſt,</hi> and to teach the maker of the Feaſt charity, in bidding Gueſts; <hi>ſcil. the poor, the maimed, the lame, the blind.</hi>
               <note place="margin">Ver. 12, 13, 14.</note> When one of the company petitioned him, to com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand
<pb n="216" facs="tcp:120106:117"/>his Brother to divide the inheritance with him, Chriſt cautioned them againſt Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vetouſneſs by the example of the rich man, who built greater barns,
<note place="margin">Luk. 12.13, 14, 15, 16, to 22.</note> and loſt his ſoul. Thus Chriſt took occaſion <hi>from Gods provi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence to birds and flowers,</hi> feeding the one, and cloathing the other, to ſpeak of Gods proviſio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal care for his Children; ſhall hee not much more feed and cloath them?
<note place="margin">Mat. 6.26, 28, 30. Joh. 4.10.</note> are not they much better than theſe? — <hi>from the water of</hi> Jacobs <hi>well,</hi> and his asking of it to ſpeak to the wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man of <hi>Samaria,</hi> of the water of life, and to provoke her to thirſt after it, and to ask it of him — <hi>from meat,</hi> and his Diſciples putting him in mind of it, when he was hungry, faint, and weary, to ſpeak to them of ſpirituall meat hee had to eat which they knew not of;
<note place="margin">Joh. 4.31. to 35.</note> 
               <hi>my meat is</hi> (ſai<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>h hee) <hi>to do the will of him that ſent mee, and to finiſh his work, from the mention of b<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>ead,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Mat. 16, 5, 6.</note> which the Diſciples had forgotten to take, hee preſſeth on them a caution to take heed of the leaven of the Phariſees;
<note place="margin">Joh. 6.26, 27.</note> — <hi>from the peoples ſecking him, not for love, but for loaves,</hi> hee perſwaded them to labour not for periſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, but for enduring meat; <hi>from the example of a little child,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Mat. 18.1.2, 3, &amp;c.</note> whom hee ſet in the midſt of his Diſciples, hee taught them to bee humble, harmleſſe, and to avoid offences. Thus wee ſhould in imitation of Chriſt, watch for any occaſion which the company or any preſent, their words, Acts, Geſtures, or any accidents may afford us, of ſpeaking what may con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duce to their ſouls good; take any hint we can for the ſame, to ſcrue and wind in good diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courſe by degrees, that the company may bee
<pb n="217" facs="tcp:120106:117"/>better for us, or wee for them, before we part. As <hi>Benhadads</hi> ſervants diligently obſerved whether any thing would come from King <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hab</hi> (that they might make advantage of) and did haſtily catch it,
<note place="margin">1 King. 20.32, 33.</note> to promote their Maſters buſineſſe, therefore <hi>when hee ſaid he is my Brother, they ſaid, thy Brother</hi> Benhadad. <hi>Paul</hi> praiſed what hee perceived was com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mendable in <hi>Agrippa,</hi> and watched to take hold on every word hee ſpake,
<note place="margin">Act. 26.27, 28, 29.</note> to perſwade him <hi>to become a Chriſtian;</hi> wee ſhould learn the art of tranſition, to paſs from worldly to hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venly diſcourſe, or turn the current of it into a ſpirituall channel.</p>
            <p>The Fourth Rule. Obſerve what ſubjects Gods Providence puts into your minds, and mouthes as Themes of meditation, and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munication, as common mercies, or calami<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties judgements felt or feared, the Churches afflictions, or the death of the Righteous, &amp;c. Such things as God would have the hearts of all, eſpecially of his people to bee affected with, to make an impreſſion on them.</p>
            <p>The Fifth Rule. Get ſome common heads into your minds, and hearts; that may bee of general uſe to all, and at all times; as the ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fullneſſe of ſin, the excellency of Chriſt and Grace, the vanity of Creatures, the uncertain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty and troubles of life, the approach and great conſequence of death, the laſt judgement, the joyes of Heaven, and torments of Hell, the piety and felicity of the godly, the iniquity and miſery of the wicked; eſpecially, get not only your heads fraught with notions, but your hearts fil'd with affiance in, affection to, and
<pb n="218" facs="tcp:120106:118"/>experience of Jeſus Chriſt; and ſpeak of him freely, and frequently to others, to carry Chriſt to them, or to draw them to Chriſt. As the Spouſe did of her beloved,
<note place="margin">Cant 5.10. &amp; 6.1, &amp;c.</note> to the daughters of <hi>Jeruſalem;</hi> as the two Diſciples going to <hi>Emmaus</hi> did of Jeſus of <hi>Nazareth;</hi> and the Prophet did of that good matter his heart had indited concerning Chriſt the King of Saints;
<note place="margin">Pſal. 45.1.</note> for Chriſt is a moſt ſweet, profitable, and ſucceſsfull ſubject of diſcourſe, and ever in ſeaſon.</p>
            <p>The Sixth Rule. The asking and anſwe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring of queſtions aright, may conduce much to mutual edification; As when others have doubts, and deſire to bee reſolved in matters of Religion, or in caſes of conſcience, wee may help them greatly, by giving them clear and ſound anſwers, or ſolutions there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of. This is a fruitfull way of improving time and talents, abilities and opportunities. This wee find under precept in the old Teſtament, and under practice in the New.</p>
            <p n="1">1 Under Precept in the Old Teſtament, there are commands for asking and anſwering queſtions about the word, and works of God.</p>
            <p>As, 1 Children of their Fathers, concerning</p>
            <p n="1">1 Gods Providence, <hi>ask thy Father and hee will ſhew thee;

<note place="margin">Joſh. 1.6, 7.</note> that the waters of</hi> Jordan <hi>were cut off, and

<note place="margin">Verſ. 21, 22</note> 
               <hi>That Iſrael came over this Jordan on dry land.</hi> As the Chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren were to ask the meaning of Gods great Works, ſo their Parents were enjoyned to anſwer them, and inſtruct them in the know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge thereof.</p>
            <p n="2">2 Concerning Gods Ordinances, or reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gious Services, and the meaning and reaſon of them, as of the Sacraments and admini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrations of them; Children were to ask, and their Parents were commanded to teach them, the occaſion, ſignification, and uſe thereof, as of the Paſſeover;
<note place="margin">Exod. 12.26, 27.</note> 
               <hi>When your chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren ſhall ſay, what mean you by this ſervice? yee ſhall ſay, it is the Sacrifice of the Lords Paſſeover.</hi> In like manner ſhould Chriſtians teach their Children the meaning of Goſpel-Sacraments, <hi>ſcil.</hi>
               <note place="margin">Exod. 13.14, 15.</note> Baptiſm and the Lords Sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per; ſo concerning the conſecrating of the firſt-born, ſee what that meant.</p>
            <p n="3">3 Concerning the Law of God,
<note place="margin">Deut. 6.20</note> 
               <hi>When thy Son asketh thee, what means the Teſtimonies, Statutes, and Judgements which the Lord our God hath commanded you?</hi> That is, the whole Law, Moral, Ceremonial, and Judicial?
<note place="margin">Ainſw.</note> One calls this, A brief Catechiſm, containing the Grounds of Religion.
<note place="margin">Verſ. 21. to the end.</note> Then thou ſhalt ſhew unto him the occaſion, end, and benefits thereof; the Law was given to the Fathers,
<note place="margin">pſal. 78.5, 6</note> that they ſhould make it known to their children.</p>
            <p n="2">2 People of their Miniſters,
<note place="margin">Mal. 2.7.</note> 
               <hi>The Prieſts lips ſhould keep knowledge, and they ſhould ſeek the Law at his mouth.</hi> Not only in publick by hear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
<pb n="220" facs="tcp:120106:119"/>his Doctrin, but in private alſo, by pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pounding their Doubts and Queries to him.</p>
            <p n="3">3 One private perſon of another, <hi>Thus ſhall yee ſay every one to his neighbour, and every one to his brother,
<note place="margin">Ies. 23.35.</note> what hath the Lord anſwered? and, what hath the Lord ſpoken?</hi> It is ſaid in Zech. 3.10. <hi>Yee ſhall call every man his neigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour under the Vine, and under the Fig-tree.</hi> Some underſtand this not only of a ſecure State, without all danger and fear, but of their communion together to promote the ſalvation one of another.</p>
            <p n="2">2 The duty of asking Queſtions, wee finde under practiſe and example in the New Te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtament; this was an edifying courſe to the Diſciples of Chriſt, and Primitive Chriſtians, when Chriſt ſpake theſe words concerning the removing of his bodily preſence from them,
<note place="margin">Joh; 16.16, 17</note> 
               <hi>A little while and yee ſhall not ſee me, &amp;c.</hi> The Diſciples firſt enquired among them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves what theſe words meant, and becauſe they could not ſatisfie themſelves, they were deſirous to ask Chriſt to explain himſelf,
<note place="margin">Verſ. 19, 20.21</note> which he perceiving, did; when the Diſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples heard Chriſt deliver any thing which they underſtood not, they asked him the meaning thereof when he was alone.
<note place="margin">Mark 4.10</note> As of the Parable of the Sower, and of that Parable or ſentence,
<note place="margin">Mar. 7.15.17</note> 
               <hi>That which goeth into a man can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not defile the man, but the things which come out of him.</hi>
               <note place="margin">Mar. 10.9, 10.11 Mar. 13.1, 2, 3, 4</note> And of what he ſpake concerning the indiſſolubleneſs of marriage, and the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruction of the Temple.</p>
            <p>When the Eunuch underſtood not what he read in <hi>Iſaiah</hi> concerning Chriſt,
<note place="margin">Iſa. 53.7</note> he asked
<pb n="221" facs="tcp:120106:119"/>
               <hi>Philip</hi> the meaning,
<note place="margin">Acts 8.34, 35</note> 
               <hi>I pray thee of whom ſpeak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth the Prophet this, of himſelf, or of ſome other man?</hi> Then <hi>Philip</hi> opened the Scripture to him. Let Chriſtians take notice of their doubts and ſcruples, and wait for an occaſion to propound them to ſuch as are able to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolve them. To queſtion much is the way to learn much, eſpecially if the queſtions bee ſuited to the Askers neceſſity, and to the An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwerers faculty; this is the way to glean up knowledge.
<note place="margin">Col. 4.6</note> There is a dexterity in asking and anſwering queſtions aright.</p>
            <p n="1">1 Queſtions ſhould be asked, not out of curioſity to ſhew wit, or pleaſe fancy, or to ſcratch an itching humour; but in ſincerity, out of love to the truth to know it, to the end we may do it, and readily to ſubmit to it, when it is diſcovered to us.</p>
            <p n="2">2 Not about things that are vain and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>profitable, but what may tend to godly edi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fying, in faith and love,
<note place="margin">1 Tim. 1.4</note> in holineſs and obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience.</p>
            <p n="3">3 Avoyd ſubtile and acute Queſtions in common diſcourſe, which as one ſaith, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſemble Crafiſhes, where there is more pick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing work, than meat to eat. Theſe ingender ſtrife of words, vain janglings, and animo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſities.</p>
            <p n="4">4 Queſtions of Religion ſhould bee deba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted without pride and paſſion, or deſire of praiſe or victory, but in a ſpirit of love and meekneſs, that truth may be made to appear; to ſtrike fire, that by the ſparks of Argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, we may light the lamp of truth.
<note place="margin">1 Tim. 6.4</note> Here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by we ſhould not contend who ſhould get
<pb n="222" facs="tcp:120106:120"/>the better, but that truth may prevail, and get the victory over ignorance and errour, or be drawn forth to light, out of the Pavillion of darkneſs, or obſcurity, under which it hath lain hid; but obſtinacy in opinon renders a man culpable of great imperfections, and lia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble to many exceptions.</p>
            <p>Seventh Rule. It is lawful, and may bee ſometimes needful to diſcourſe of Natural, Moral, and Civil matters to improve our knowledge in them, and to get direction for the better manageing of ſuch affairs, whether publick or private, reſpecting our bodies, relations, or eſtates; or common buſineſs, which we have one with another.
<note place="margin">Pſal. 112.5</note> Diſcourſe about them may help us to guide our affairs with diſcretion.
<note place="margin">1 King. 4.32, 33</note> The three thouſand Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verbs <hi>Solomon</hi> ſpake were of Natural and Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral Philoſophy (and it is like of policy) as well as of Divinity. But it is good to inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mingle ſome Spiritual diſcourſe to ſeaſon it with, and to take heed that earthly things be not made the whole and ſole ſubject of our ſpeech, as the moſt do in their meetings; which ſpeak them to bee meer worldlings in their hearts,
<note place="margin">Os hominis ſublime dedit, &amp;c.</note> when they have nothing but the World in their mouthes. As God hath given a man a ſublime countenance, to look up a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bove earth to Heaven, ſo an excellent facul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty of ſpeech, to ſpeak of Heaven as well as earth, of Divine and Spiritual, as of Tempo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral and Terreſtrial things, for the glory of God, and good of ſouls, as well as for external commodities.</p>

Of Urbanity.</p>
            <p>Yea, it may bee convenient ſometimes to uſe Recreational ſpeeches (or mirth in con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ference) this is urbanity, or pleaſantneſs of ſpeech, which is lawful.</p>
            <p n="1">1 Becauſe there is a time to laugh,
<note place="margin">Eccleſ. 3.4</note> as well as a time to weep; to be merry, as to be ſad. And God hath given a man a power and fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culty for the one as well as for the other, and Gods people have uſed it, as the Jews,
<note place="margin">Pſa. 126.1, 2</note> 
               <hi>When God returned the captivity of Zion, then our mouthes were filled with laughter, and our tongues with ſinging.</hi>

            <p n="2">2 Becauſe the Preacher commands mirth, and ſaith,

               <hi>There is nothing better under the Sun than for a man to eat, and drink, and bee merry, for this is a mans portion;</hi> which he ſpeaks not as a ſenſual voluptuous Epicure, but as a ſober diſcreet experienced man. There is no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing better under the Sun than for a man to have and uſe what he enjoyeth with delight and cheerfulneſs. Now pleaſantneſs of ſpeech is one means of honeſt mirth, and may con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duce as to the cheerfulneſs of the mind, ſo (in the Conſequent) to the healthfulneſs of the body.</p>

            </p>
            <p>I will lay down four Rules for ordering Recreational ſpeeches.</p>
            <p n="1">1 For the matter of them, they muſt bee harmleſs, without any ſcurrility, obſcenity, bitterneſs, or abuſiveneſs in any kind, or juſt offence to any, without girds, or taunts at ſome, to pleaſe others; we muſt take heed of jeaſting, either of ſacred things, as Religion, or Scripture, for that is the badge of a pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phane ſpirit, <hi>Julian</hi> the Apoſtate uſed it; or of things ſerious, for that would argue petu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lancy of wit, or of things calamitous as the miſeries of others, for that would ſhew in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>humanity in us;
<note place="margin">Epheſ. 5.4</note> ſuch is fooliſh talking and jeaſting, which is not convenient, <hi>Paul</hi> prohi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bits it,

<pb n="225" facs="tcp:120106:121"/>but the Apoſtle uſeth it in an ill ſenſe; for ſcurrilous jeaſting in an unſeemly manner, which conſiſts not with the ſanctity and gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vity of a Chriſtian. Thus as ſome Criticks obſerve, mens ill manners have ſpoyled the uſe or ſenſe of good words, as I could inſtance in ſeveral particulars.</p>
            <p n="2">2 Recreational ſpeeches muſt for the manner of them bee ſeaſoned with ſalt, <hi>ſcil.</hi> not of wit only, but of wiſdom, modeſty,

Speak not out of affectation of praiſe, or delight to hear our ſelves ſpeak well, but out of deſire of do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing good, or of drawing others to do well. Many ſpeak againſt eloquence, as they do a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt learning, out of ignorance, becauſe they know not the worth or uſe of it, for Art hath no enemy but an ignorant perſon; but I ſpeak only againſt the proud and vain uſe and ſhew of it.</p>

            <p n="1">1 Eloquence may bee uſed, yea there may be good uſe of it, becauſe</p>
            <p n="1">1 Eloquence is the gift of God; which hee beſtows on ſome of his ſervants, not on others, as on <hi>Aaron.</hi> I know (ſaith God) to <hi>Moſes,</hi> of him,

               <note place="margin">Act. 18.24</note> None of Gods ſervants ſhould open their mouthes to ſpeak againſt any of God gifts, of which, eloquence or the faculty of ſpeech is one.</p>
            <p n="2">2 Eloquence is a flower of ſpeech, both for beauty and ſweetneſſe, which ſets off ſpeech with greater grace, obtains audience with greater delight, and inſinuates with more ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficacy.</p>
            <p>Though the Goſpel was preached at firſt, with greateſt plainneſs of ſpeech,
<note place="margin">1 Cor. 1.17 and 2.4</note> yet God hath bleſſed it ſince to the furtherance of the goſpel The ſweetning of ſpeech with eloquence hath been a means ſometimes of winning others to hear &amp; embrace the Goſpel, &amp; Chriſt in it.

Both hiſtoryes and experience declare, that God beſtowed an excellent faculty of elocution upon many of his ſervants, (both ancient and modern divines) whoſe labours hee bleſſed to the Converſion of many ſouls, and to the e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dification of the Church.</p>
            <p n="4">4 God threatens it as a judgement to take away from <hi>Jeruſalem,</hi> and from <hi>Judah,

Though it bee acquired, yet it ſhould not be ſtrain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed or forced, as ſome uſe it in imitation of others, which to judicious cars ſounds harſh and ungrateful.</p>
            <p n="2">2 Whether our eloquence bee naturall or acquired, how ever wee come by it, wee ſhould uſe it without affectation, and oſten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation, and not pride our ſelves in wit, words or phraſes. An humble Chriſtian will forbear, or change ſuch expreſſions, as he conceives may ſeem elegant to others, and hee feels, or fears his own heart, would bee puffed up therewith; when Eloquence is affected, or boaſted, then it ſhews ſwelling vanity in the minds of the ſpeakers, and is not pleaſing in the ears of the hearers.</p>
            <p n="3">3 Wee ſhould ſtrive to bee rather ſolid then florid in our ſpeeches, yet we may uſe elegance therein, ſo that our end and aim bee more to affect the hearts, than tickle the ears of our Auditors.

            <p n="2">2 This is acceptable to Jeſus Chriſt, who the ſame day after hee was riſen again, aſſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciated himſelf (above all others) with the two Diſciples going to <hi>Emmaus,</hi> who were talking together of Chriſt,

How well hee is pleaſed, and what pleaſure hee takes in his people, when they are talking together of him, and of the things of God, as hee did in theſe two Diſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples to whom hee joyned himſelf, and made a third.

            <p n="1">1 His ſpeciall preſence with them (in a ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rituall not corporall way) though they be but two or three met together in his name, to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferre as well as to pray together,

            <p n="2">2 His aſſiſtance of one or other to expound the Scriptures, to open the matters concerning Chriſt, or to ſpeak ſomething to edifica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.</p>
            <p n="3">3 His bleſſing upon what is then ſpoken, to ſet it home, to them that hear it, for their good, either to open their eyes, or to warm their hearts.</p>
            <p n="4">4 Some clear diſcoveries of Chriſt to them therein to make them know him better, that they may declare to others afterwards their ſweet experiences hereof, as the two Diſciples went immediately to <hi>Jeruſalem</hi> to the eleven

            <p>The Fifth Particular caſe is conſolation.
<note place="margin">Conſolation.</note> Chriſtians ought to comfort one another; this ſhould bee mutuall and reciprocall amongſt them, — <hi>Comfort one another,
<note place="margin">1 Theſ. 5.11.</note> and edify one ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, even as alſo yee do;</hi> this duty hath a double confirmation in the text.</p>
            <p n="1">1 The <hi>Theſſalonians</hi> practice, they did ſo already.</p>

            </p>
            <p>Touching this duty, I ſhall give you

            <p>Rules for comforting others.</p>
            <p>Firſt Rule, wee ſhould know their caſe, what is the kind and cauſe of their trouble, whether it bee inward, or outward, ſpirituall, or temporall, reſpecting ſoul or body, friends, goods, or name; and the dimenſions of their ſorrow, elſe wee cannot tell how to deal par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticularly and effectually with them; the Phy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſician muſt know his patients diſeaſe; and the Chirurgeon his ſore, before they can apply proper healing ſalves or medicines, wee muſt
<pb n="240" facs="tcp:120106:129"/>take meaſure of their condition, before wee can cut out or ſhape a ſuit of conſolation fit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting for them. <hi>Paul</hi> ſent <hi>Tychicus</hi> unto the <hi>Coloſſians</hi> for the ſame purpoſe,
<note place="margin">Col. 4.8.</note> 
               <hi>that hee might know their eſtate, and comfort their hearts.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The Second Rule. When we know their eſtate, wee ſhould pity them, and ſympathize with them,
<note place="margin">Col. 3.12.</note> for comfort commeth out of the bowels of mercies (which wee ſhould put on) as the fruits thereof;
<note place="margin">Job 19.21. c. 6.14.</note> which <hi>Job<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

               </hi> friends wan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted towards him in his miſeries (though hee beg'd it earneſtly of them; — <hi>have pity upon mee, have pity upon mee, O ye my friends, for the hand of God hath touched mee;</hi> therefore they proved <hi>miſerable comforters,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Job 2.11.</note> though <hi>they came to mourn with him, and to comfort him.</hi> God is firſt a Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther of mercies, then a God of all conſolati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons,
<note place="margin">2 Cor. 1.3, 4.</note> hee comforts his people becauſe he pities them; Conſolation flows from Compaſſion both in God and man, except wee lay others caſes to our hearts, wee will not ſpeak to their hearts.</p>
            <p>The Third Rule. When wee know their caſes and pity them, wee ſhould apply com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forts ſuitable to their needs, as</p>
            <p n="1">1
<note place="margin">Mat. 6.</note> If their caſe bee neceſſity, obſerve how Chriſt comforts his Diſciples againſt outward wants.</p>

            <p n="2">2 From Gods Knowledge of their neceſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties,
<pb n="241" facs="tcp:120106:129"/>
               <hi>Your heavenly Father knoweth all things yee have need of.</hi>

            <p n="3">3 Mourners for miſery ought to bee com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forted, as for neceſſities, death of friends, per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſecutions, or any outward afflictions, as the <hi>Jews</hi> Captives in <hi>Babylon,</hi> God gave charge they ſhould bee comforted (ſo ſome under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtand that place) by publiſhing to them the approach of their deliverance,

            <p>The Fourth Sort are ſeekers of Chriſt,
<note place="margin">Cant. 3.1, 2.</note> theſe are objects of comfort; as the Spouſe when ſhe ſought her Beloved up and down, night and day; in her bed, and in the broad wayes. The watchmen ſhould have comforted her with tidings of her beloved, but did not; yea they ſmote and wounded her,

3 Take journeys to comfort ſuch as are caſt down, and diſconſolate, even the preſence and viſits of friends are comfortable. <hi>Paul</hi> beg'd of God hee might have a proſperous journey to the Saints at <hi>Rome,</hi> (for hee longed to ſee them, to impart, ſome ſpirituall gift to them, to eſtabliſh them, to comfort them, and to bee comforted in them,
<note place="margin">Rom. 1.10, 11, 12.</note> by the mutuall faith of them, and him. For the ſame end and purpoſe <hi>Paul</hi> prayed exceedingly night and day, to ſee the <hi>Theſſalonians</hi> face,
<note place="margin">1 Theſ. 3.9, 10, 11.</note> and that God the Father, and God the Son would direct his way unto them. So much of the Rules. Now follow the Reaſons why wee ſhould comfort others, which may bee drawn from four heads.</p>
            <p n="1">1 The neceſſity and commodity of com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fort, in reſpect of others.</p>
            <p n="2">2 The miſery of them that want it.</p>
            <p n="3">3 The excellency of the duty it ſelf.</p>
            <p n="4">4 The equity of it in reſpect of our ſelves.</p>
            <p n="1">1 <hi>Reaſ.</hi> The Neceſſity and Commodity of comfort in afflictions, in reſpect of others, both ſouls and bodyes, as well as our own.</p>
            <p n="1">1 Comfort is needfull and uſefull for the ſpirits of others, in ſix reſpects.</p>
            <p n="1">1 To ſupport them, or bear them up from ſinking under the preſſures of troubles in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward, or outward. Comfort is that to an heart (that is loadened with grief) to uphold it, which a prop or ſhore is to a houſe, that is ready to fall; which a hand is to one that is oppreſſed with a heavy burden to take it off; or which a ſhoulder being put under, is, to help him to bear it.
<note place="margin">Pro. 18.14.</note> 
               <hi>The ſpirit of a man</hi> (being ſhored up with Comfort) <hi>will ſuſtain his infirmities,
<pb n="255" facs="tcp:120106:137"/>but a wounded ſpirit</hi> (that wants the healing plaiſter of Conſolation) <hi>is intollerable;</hi> it is like a prick in the ſhoulder that hath a heavy bur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den upon it, who can bear it?</p>
            <p n="2">2 To quicken them, or keep life in their ſpirits; and to preſerve or recover them from fainting, and ſwounding. Comforts are revi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving cordialls. Comfort is the life of our ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rits, yea the life of our lives; without which life would bee no life, but a lingring death. <hi>Now wee live</hi> (ſaith <hi>Paul</hi>) <hi>if ye ſtand faſt in the Lord,</hi> that is,
<note place="margin">1 Theſ. 3.8.</note> our lives are made comfortable to us by the joy and comfort we take in your ſtedfaſtneſſe, that is, wee injoy the comfort of our lives, by the joy and comfort we take in your perſeverance. The damned though they live in Hell, are ſaid to dye eternally, becauſe their ſtate is void of all joy and comfort, whereas to make the hearts of them ſad, by ſlanders, revilings, bitter ſpeeches, or other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe, and to impair the cheerfullneſs of their ſpirits, and dead them,
<note place="margin">Ezek. 13, 22.</note> is a kind or degree of murder. It is murder in divinity, though not in civill policie.</p>
            <p n="3">3 Comfort is needfull and uſefull for others, to chear, refreſh and rejoyce their drooping ſpirits, to raiſe them up from their ſorrow and ſadneſſe, which hath bowed down their ſouls even to the duſt. <hi>In the multitude of my</hi> (ſad troubled) <hi>thoughts within me,</hi> ſaith <hi>David,
<note place="margin">Pſal. 94.19.</note> thy Comforts</hi> (which are breathed into mee by thy ſpirit, or handed to mee by thy ſervants) <hi>de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>light my ſoul.</hi> Comforts poure the oyl of glad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs into hearts full of heavineſſe; take off their mourning garments, and cloath them
<pb n="256" facs="tcp:120106:138"/>with cheerfullneſs. <hi>Joy is</hi> (as one calls it) <hi>the ſpring of our year,
<note place="margin">Mr. Caryl.</note> the light of our day, the Sun in our firmament.</hi> Comfort is honey in the mouth, melody in the ear, and a Jubilee in the heart. Comforts in ſeaſon, that is (when others ſtand in need of them, and are fit to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive them) are very ſweet, like flowers in <hi>May,</hi> or apples fully ripe, or like the ſinging of birds in the Spring.

            <p n="3">3 By Diſpenſation (or by Office) as he is our Prophet,
<note place="margin">Iſa. 61.1, 2, 3</note> which he executes (and ſo com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forteth us) by his Spirit which he hath given us.</p>
            <p n="3">3 God the Holy Ghoſt is the Author of Conſolation, by application of it to us (for that is his proper work) of all that comfort to our hearts, which the Father hath appointed to us, and which Chriſt hath obtained and keeps for us.

<note place="margin">Mat. 7.12</note> for this is the Law and the Prophets. This duty ſhould be mutual and reciprocal among Chriſtians, even thoſe that comfort others may ſtand in need to be com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forted by others, as <hi>Eliphaz</hi> told <hi>Job.</hi>
               <note place="margin">Job 4.4, 5</note> Thou comfortedſt others, &amp;c. <hi>But now it</hi> (that is, the affliction and miſery) <hi>is come upon thee, and thou fainteſt, it toucheth thee, and thou art troubled,</hi> i.e. Thou now haſt as much need to be comforted by others, as others had to be comforted by thee, <hi>Is not this thy fear, and thy confidence? &amp;c.</hi>
               <note place="margin">Verſ. 6.</note> This was the errour of <hi>Jobs</hi> friends, to lay down good premiſes, and to infer bad concluſions, by miſapplying the ſame to <hi>Job,</hi> as if he were an Hypocrite,

            <p n="2">2 Becauſe all true Chriſtians have an inte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reſt in comfort, it is their portion; in com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forting them wee give them that which is their own; and in not doing it we with-hold from them what of due belongs to them.</p>
            <p n="3">3 To this end God gives us abilities and ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>periences, that we may be able to comfort o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers; upon the account whereof wee are Debtors to others;

As the Moon and Starres re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive
<pb n="264" facs="tcp:120106:142"/>light from the Sun, not to hoard it up in themſelves (like dark Lanthorns) but to reflect it upon the earth, and things below; ſo we receive comfort freely from the Lord, to the end we ſhould give comfort freely to others.</p>
            <p n="4">4 Laſtly, This is our Office as wee are members of the ſame body with others. As the Stomack firſt feeds it ſelf with the food it concocts, then communicates nouriſhment to all other members, the Heart and Liver ſend forth ſpirits and bloud throughout the body, when they have received nouriſhment and ſtrength: ſo every Joynt or Member in Chriſts myſtical Body, ſhould make a ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ply of conſolation, or inſtruction, &amp;c. that is, of what may nouriſh, ſtrengthen, and encreaſe to his Fellow-members,
<note place="margin">Epheſ. 4.16</note> according to the meaſure of that gift or grace hee hath received from his head Chriſt Jeſus.

<note place="margin">Pſal. 103.11, 12 Verſ. 17</note> and all their unworthineſſes in multitude, and in magnitude, in all dimenſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, and in duration. Gods mercy is like the great deep Ocean (without bank or bot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tom) which can as eaſily ſwallow up moun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tains of ſins, as mole-hills, or motes. There<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore to doubt, or deſpair, or to give way to deſpondency of mind, is to forſake our own mercy, to ſin againſt mercy, which is one of the higheſt, and moſt confounding aggrava<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions of ſin.
<note place="margin">Lam. 3.22</note> Set alſo before them the bowels of Gods compaſſions, which are moſt tender and yearning, and fail not; the riches of his free Grace (which are the Treaſures of Eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity) that cannot be diminiſhed by diſtribu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, but rather like the five Loaves where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>with Chriſt fed the five thouſand men, beſide women &amp; children, they multiply with break<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing; and the freeneſs, unchangeableneſs, and everlaſtingneſs of his love to poor ſinners,

            </p>

            <p>Jeſus Chriſt was a perfect Anatomy of an afflicted ſoul (as Mr.
<note place="margin">Mat. 26.38.</note> 
               <hi>Greenham</hi> calls him) in
<pb n="272" facs="tcp:120106:146"/>his agony, both in the garden, when hee ſaid, <hi>my ſoul is exceeding ſorrowful, even unto death;</hi> which made him pray thrice moſt fervently,
<note place="margin">Luk. 22.44</note> to his father, <hi>If it bee poſſible let this cup paſſe from mee,</hi> and made him ſweat great drops of blood falling down to the ground; — and on the croſſe (for his agony continued leſſe or more till his death, when hee cryed out, being ready to breath out his laſt) <hi>my God, my God, why haſt thou forſaken mee?</hi> when the wrath of God for our ſinnes lay upon his hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mane ſoul in the weight of it, the Godhead with-drawing it ſelf for a while as to ſenſe, not to ſupport. Chriſts example in this caſe is moſt comfortable for an afflicted conſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence, you may read of ſuch dreadful deſerti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons ſtoried in the lives of many, who were dear to God. I will relate three remarkable examples, which are well collected by Mr. <hi>Bol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ton</hi> in his inſtructions for comforting afflicted conſciences, becauſe this little peece may come into ſome hands, who have not read the ſame in any other book. Mr. <hi>Peacock,</hi> a wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thy ſervant of God, when hee reckoned with himſelf about ſome ſmaller ſinnes, for theſe (ſaith hee) I feel now an Hell in my conſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence; upon other occaſions (as the viſits and ſpeeches of his friends) hee groaned and cri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed out lamentably. Oh mee wretch! Oh, mine heart is miſerable! Oh, Oh, miſerable and woful, the burden of my ſinnes lyeth ſo heavy upon mee, I doubt it will break my heart! oh, how woful and mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerable is my ſtate, that thus muſt converſe with hell-hounds? — But before his end hee
<pb n="273" facs="tcp:120106:146"/>was wonderfully recovered, and raiſed up, from his depth of ſpirituall miſery, to a height of heavenly joy and comfort, as appears by his ſpeeches. — I do (ſaith hee) God be praiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed; feel ſuch comfort from that, what ſhall I call it? Agony, ſaid one that ſtood by, nay, ſaith hee, that is too little; had I five thouſand worlds. I could not make ſatisfa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction for ſuch an iſſue. Oh the Sea is not more full of water, nor the Sunne of light, than the Lord of mercy; yea, his mercies are ten thouſand times more; what great cauſe have I to magnify the great goodnes of God that hath humbled, nay rather exalted ſuch a wretched miſcreant, to an eſtate ſo glorious, and ſtate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly. The Lord hath honoured mee with his goodneſſe. The joy that I feel in my heart is incredible. Mr. <hi>Glover,</hi> of whom you may read in the Acts and Monuments, was exerci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed divers years with tentations, ſtings of Conſcience, unexpreſſible pangs of grief, and buffetings of Satan. Upon apprehenſion of ſome backſliding, hee was ſo perplexed, that if hee had been in the deepeſt pit of hell, he could almoſt have deſpaired no more of his ſalvation, which exceedingly waſted his body, decayed his ſenſes, ſo as he could have no joy of his meat, yet hee was forced to eat againſt his appetite, to defer the time of his damnation, ſo long as hee might; conceiving he ſhould be thrown down into hell, as ſoon as the breath was out of his body; yet afterward hee was ſo raiſed, raviſhed and ſpiritualized, that as (Mr. <hi>Fox</hi> relates) hee was like one placed in heaven already, and dead in this
<pb n="274" facs="tcp:120106:147"/>world, both in word, and meditation, and he led a life altogether celeſtial. This alſo you may read in the narration of the holy life, and Chriſtian death of Miſtris <hi>Katherine Bre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tergh.</hi> The ſorrows of Hell ſeized upon her ſoul, before her death ſhe ſaid a roaring wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derneſs of woe was within her, that her ſins had made her a prey to Satan, and wiſhed ſhe had never been born, or that ſhee had been made any other Creature, rather than a woman; ſhee burſt out many times, ſay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, woe, woe, woe, &amp;c. a weak, a woefull, a wretched and forſaken woman; with tears continually trickling from her eyes; But af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terwards God came to her with fulneſs of joy, and abundance of Conſolations, and put tri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>umphant ſongs into her mouth; as, oh, Bleſſed bee thy Name, my Lord, and my God, the joys that I feel in my ſoul; O, they be wonder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full, as certain as thou art the God of truth, even ſo ſure do I know my ſelf to bee thine, O bleſſed bee the Lord that hath thus comforted mee, and brought mee now to a place more ſweet to mee than the garden of <hi>Eden,</hi> Oh the joy, the joy, the delightſome joy that I feel. Lay your ſorrows in the ballance of ſound judge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment with theirs, and ſee whether theirs or yours bee heavier. Are you better than all or any of theſe holy ſervants of God, that you ſhould think your ſelves exempt from the like ſoul-troubles? can theſe be a ſign of Gods reje<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cting wrath to you, which befell theſe that were the objects of Gods ſpeciall love? Yea is not this your conformity to Chriſt, in agonies or inward diſtreſſes of ſpirit, which you may

            </p>
            <p>The eighth Ground of Conſolation. Set before them, and apply unto them two things.</p>
            <p n="1">1 Grace may bee hid for a time in the heart, and not be diſcerned by them that have it, like ſparks of fire in the aſhes, or life in a ſwound, or bits of gold in a duſt heap, or pearls in the mire; like ſtars in the sky in a dark night, they are all there, yet not one of them doth appear; like ſtones in the bottom of a Veſſel, or River, which are not ſeen when the water is troubled, thick or muddy; like ſtools or chairs in a room where there is no light; for that which makes manifeſt is light. There is a difference between the being of a thing in it
<pb n="282" facs="tcp:120106:151"/>ſelf, and the appearing or diſcovery thereof to us. As many things ſeem to bee which are not, ſo ſome things are (or really exiſt) which ſometimes ſeem not, or appear not to bee, as what things are under ground, or lockt up cloſe, and laid out of ſight, or though they lie open, they lack light to manifeſt them; when the ſoul is in a troubled ſtate of ſtrong temptations or ſtirring corruptions, or in a ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rituall ſwound of deſertions, and wants the beamings forth of light from the Spirit of God, to evidence to it the good work God hath begun in it; In ſuch a caſe the truth and life of grace may abide in the heart, though it do not appear to the eye of the ſoul, and what afflicted ſouls cannot diſcern in themſelves, they are apt to deny to bee in them. Chriſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans have their ſeverall ſtates, as the year hath its ſeaſons, to wit, their winter or dead time of Tentation and deſertion, wherein all ſeems dead &amp; withered with them as with the earth; and grace is hid in the heart, as ſap in the Roots of Trees, as flowers and fruits are hid in the ſeeds, or Roots, in the Earth, in the win<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, as well as their ſpring of growth, and ſum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer of joy;
<note place="margin">Hoſ. 14.5, 6, 7</note> when the Lord is as dew to them, and they revive as the Corn, and grow as the Vine, and bloſſom as the Lillie, and caſt forth their roots, ſpread their branches, and their beauty is as the Olive Tree, and their ſmell as <hi>Lebanon.</hi> Mr. <hi>Peacock</hi> (of whom I ſpake before) in the time of his fore and ſad tentati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons complained to ſome of his beſt friends, that God had curſed him, being asked how hee knew it, hee anſwered, the event ſhews it, <hi>I
<pb n="283" facs="tcp:120106:151"/>have no grace, I have no more ſenſe of grace than theſe Curtains, than a Gooſe, than that block;</hi> when a friend requeſted him to bee of good comfort, and to pluck up his ſpirit, <hi>I cannot,</hi> ſaid hee, why can you not? <hi>Becauſe I have no grace, no more than a ſtake;</hi> why think you ſo? <hi>by this Affliction.</hi> Its certain this holy man of God had grace in this his deep and dreadfull plunge, but becauſe he could not per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive it, he did deny it. Preſs theſe home to affli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cted ſouls, not to judge themſelves by preſent ſenſe, or what they ſee or feel, for grace may bee in them of a truth, and they not ſee it, and they may bee the Children of the day, and not diſcern it; but by former experience, to recol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lect themſelves, whether they have not here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tofore diſcovered the work of grace in them, by the effects, ſigns, and ſymptomes thereof. Then perſwade them into the beleef hereof, as a ſound certain truth of God, that true grace, whereſoever it is may bee in an eclipſe or laps, or decay for a time; but they that have it cannot loſe it, nor fall from it totally or fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nally. Becauſe</p>
            <p n="1">1 Its the ſeed of God which remains in e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very Child of God,
<note place="margin">1 Joh. 3.9</note> and keeps poſſeſſion of the ſoul for God; and can never be wholly rooted out. Grace may be to ſeek ſometimes, or out of the way, when wee have occaſion to look at it, or to uſe it, but it cannot bee loſt, as things in a houſe may bee to ſeek, yet are laid up ſafe, and found afterwards, as a knife, or gloves.</p>
            <p n="2">2
<note place="margin">Rom. 11.29</note> The Gifts and calling of God are with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out repentance, that is, the gifts of grace, and
<pb n="284" facs="tcp:120106:152"/>effectuall calling, God doth not give theſe and take them again from any of his ſervants, but to continue to bee theirs, and to abide with them for ever.</p>
            <p n="3">3 The perpetuity of grace in them is foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded upon the immutability of God, and his free mercy, good will, and everlaſting love to them;
<note place="margin">Heb. 13.8 Joh. 13.1</note> that as hee is for ever the ſame in his Affection to them, ſo hee will continue them to bee ever the ſame in their relation to him, <hi>ſcil.</hi> his Confederates, Sons, Saints, Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vants.</p>
            <p n="4">4 Becauſe both they and the grace of God in them are kept by the power of God unto ſal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation.
<note place="margin">1 Pet. 1.5</note> So that they that once had the grace of God can never loſe it wholly, though they would; becauſe it is kept by the arms of eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity in them and for them. None is able to pluck grace out of them,
<note place="margin">Ioh. 10.28, 29</note> no more than to pluck them out of Gods hand. They may fall in the ſtate of grace, but they cannot fall out of it.</p>
            <p n="5">5 Becauſe the golden chain of Salvation is irrefragable, and all the Links in it are inſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parable, <hi>Rom.</hi> 8.30. — <hi>Whom hee calleth, them hee hath predeſtinated, and them hee will certain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly juſtifie and glorifie.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Acquaint ſuch poor ſouls that grace hath its ſeaſons of hiding it ſelf, and of appearing or ſhewing it ſelf, as the Sun hath his time of ſetting and riſing; The Moon hath her times of eclypſe, and of the full. As the fruits of the Earth have their times of being under ground and above ground. As night and day have their Viciſſitudes. Now for you to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clude
<pb n="285" facs="tcp:120106:152"/>the <hi>non</hi> exiſtence of grace in you from the <hi>non</hi> appearance of it to you; that you have it not, becauſe you ſee it not, is as if you ſhould ſay, becauſe the Sun is ſet, it will riſe no more, becauſe it is night or dark, it will not bee day or light again; becauſe it is Winter now, wee ſhall have no more Summer; becauſe the Moon is in an eclyps, therefore ſhee will ſhine no more, at leaſt never be in the full again.</p>
            <p>Perſwade them to defer paſſing ſentence upon themſelves untill they bee in a calm e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtate, or in a capacity to make a right judge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of themſelves. Then let them ſearch their hearts, which is like raking abroad of the aſhes to find out the ſparks of grace, and dig deep by ſelf-examination, to diſcover the root of the matter to bee in them; and wait upon God, to this end, to light the Candle of their ſpirits, to look into all the corners of their hearts, and ſee what is there; and diſcern what is gold, and what droſſe, what is preci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous, and what vile in their ſouls.</p>
            <p>While their ſpirits are in a confuſed perplex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed ſtate, Importune them to hearken to the Counſel of Chriſtian friends, who may (at ſuch a time) bee better able to judge of them, and their caſe, than they are of themſelves (as Phyſicians do better underſtand the ſtate of their ſick Patients, than themſelves) and who may more clearly diſcern grace in them, than they can in themſelves; and therefore ought to declare and make out the ſame to them, <hi>ſcil.</hi> that they have grace in deed, though not in view, or though they deny it, or do not ſee it. — When you have to deal with ſuch, ſet
<pb n="286" facs="tcp:120106:153"/>your ſelves to obſerve, and diſcover <hi>Aliquid Chriſti,</hi> what you can of Chriſt, and grace in them, watch diligently if any word fall from them that may give you hope or a hint thereof.</p>
            <p>The ſecond Thing to bee ſet before them is this, The deſire of grace is grace. Deſires after Chriſt and grace, to beleeve, repent, o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bey to ſerve, and pleaſe God, to bee delivered from the dominion of ſin, are Grace.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Reaſ.</hi> 1 Becauſe true deſires have the na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture and truth of grace in them, though in a ſcantling, and ſmall meaſure; As there is true fire in a ſpark, as well as in a flame, and true water in a drop, as in a ſtream, true light in a Beam, as in the Sun. The filings of gold, are true gold, as well as the whole wedge. — The leaſt of any thing partakes of the na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture of the whole.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Reaſ.</hi> 2 Becauſe Deſires are the ſeeds or beginnings of grace in the ſoul, out of which grace grows up to its meaſure of ſtature; as a Corn ſown in the Earth, whence grows the blade,
<note place="margin">Mar. 1.28</note> ſtalk, Ear, and full Corn in the Ear, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to its kind. — As a Grain of Muſtard-ſeed is the leaſt of all ſeeds when it is ſown, but the greateſt among herbs when it is grown,
<note place="margin">Mat. 13.31, 32</note> it becommeth a Tree. — So deſires are grace in the feed, Habits are grace in the blade, or ſtalk; Acts or works are grace in the Ear, and perfect works are full Corn in the Ear. — Grace is one of the leaſt things at firſt, but it is the property of grace, even when it is lodged in deſires, or in the firſt, and leaſt de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gree of it, to grow up, and riſe higher.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Reaſ.</hi> 3. Becauſe good deſires are accep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted,
<pb n="287" facs="tcp:120106:153"/>and rewarded with God as well as deeds, yea for deeds, when power to perform and actuate them is wanting.
<note place="margin">2 Cor. 8.12</note> 
               <hi>If there bee firſt a willing mind</hi> (ſaith the Apoſtle) <hi>it is accepted according to that a man hath, and not according to that a man hath not.</hi> God eſtimates his peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple rather according to their affections than their actions, for ordinarily their hearts are larger than their hands, and they deſire to do more than they are able. The firſt fruits of deſires are well-pleaſing to God, as well as the whole lump of performance. God took it kindly from <hi>David,</hi>
               <note place="margin">1 King. 8.18</note> that it was in his heart to build him a houſe (though he would not accept it at his hand) and for a recompence, God promiſeth to build him a houſe;
<note place="margin">2 Sam. 7.11</note> and from <hi>Abraham,</hi> that he was willing to offer up his only Son <hi>Iſaac</hi> to God, he accepted it as done, and bleſſed him for it, <hi>Gen.</hi> 22.12, 16. ſaying, <hi>Becauſe thou haſt done this thing, and haſt not with-held thy Son, thine only Son, in bleſſing I will bleſs thee, &amp;c.</hi> How highly did Chriſt commend the poor Widow that caſt in her two Mites into the Treaſury,
<note place="margin">Mar. 12.42, 43, 44</note> becauſe ſhe did it out of plenty of good will, though out of penury of her eſtate, for theſe were here wealth, all ſhe had, even all her living. As on the contrary, the evil deſires, and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cupiſcence of the heart are reckoned, and pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhed by God as deeds,
<note place="margin">Mat. 5.28</note> 
               <hi>Whoſoever looks on a woman to luſt after her, hath committed Adul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tery already with her in his heart,</hi> ſaith our Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viour. A man may commit Murther, Theft, Adultery, as well in deſires, and affections in his heart, as in deeds, or action, with his
<pb n="288" facs="tcp:120106:154"/>hand. So a Chriſtian may beleeve, repent, and do new obedience, in deſires after Chriſt and Grace, to be made able to perform all theſe, as in deed — A Chriſtians perfecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on here lies more in his <hi>Affections</hi> than in his <hi>Actions;</hi> therefore Gods Servants have plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded their wills, and deſires before God, ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther than their deeds as <hi>Nehemiah</hi> did,
<note place="margin">Nehem. 1.11</note> 
               <hi>Lord let thine ear bee attentive to the prayer of thy Servants,

<note place="margin">Phil. 2.13</note> for <hi>God worketh in us both to will,
<note place="margin">Chap. 1.6</note> and to do, of his own good pleaſure.</hi> They are the beginning of Gods good work in us, which he will perfect untill the Day of Chriſt; God doth not his works by halves, <hi>when I begin,

Then ſpread the promi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed Reaſons before them, to convince, and conclude them under the power and comfort of the preſent truth, that true deſires are grace. Sometimes God lays a ſoul ſo low in darkneſs, and in deeps of tentation, as it can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nor diſcern ſo much as deſires in it ſelf, as Mr.

            <p n="3">3 From a mind illightned to ſee, as the want, ſo the worth and excellency, the ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſity, and commodity of Chriſt, and Grace for the Soul, as there is of the ſoul for the bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy, without which the body would be a dead

            <p n="2">2 By the fruit or effect; true deſires put forth ſerious, and ſuitable endeavours in the uſe of means to obtain the things deſired. Such were <hi>Davids</hi> deſires — <hi>One thing I have deſired of the Lord,

               <pb n="292" facs="tcp:120106:156"/>
3 True deſires after Chriſt, and grace are diſcernable by the properties of them, which are Four.</p>
            <p n="1">1 They are ſincere.</p>
            <p n="1">1 For ground, when they are carried out after Chriſt, and Spiritual things, as well for their ſakes as for our own; for the goodneſs of them in themſelves, as well as for the good we may get by them; for the beauty, and excellency wee ſee in them, and a ſuitable<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs to our neceſſities, or out of love to them.</p>
            <p n="2">2 For ends, when deſires have Spiritual aims, as the mark they ſhoot at, in the objects about which they are converſant, to wit, to make us holy, and humble in our hearts, o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bedient and ſerviceable in our lives, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formable in both to Chriſt, and acceptable through Chriſt to God; and they do not ſcope at Temporal advantages, as to get our ſelves name, or fame, credit, or profit thereby in the world.</p>
            <p n="2">2 True deſires are ſtirring, vigorous, and vehement for temper and meaſure,
<note place="margin">Matth. 5.6</note> therefore called in Scripture, <hi>Hunger and Thirſt,</hi> which are the ſtrongeſt deſires of Nature. Such like doth Grace put forth—Holy deſires vent, and pour out themſelves in deep ſighs and groans, in earneſt pantings and breathings of ſoul, in ſtrong crys, and tears to God for Chriſt, to Chriſt for grace,
<note place="margin">Pſal. 42.1</note> ſtrength, ſpirit — <hi>As the Hart panteth after the water brooks, ſo panteth my ſoul after thee,
<note place="margin">Gen. 30.1, 2</note> O God,</hi> ſaith <hi>David;</hi> — they are like <hi>Rachel</hi> her deſire of Children, <hi>Give mee Children.</hi> ſaid ſhe, <hi>elſe I dye;</hi> or <hi>Sampſons</hi>
               <pb n="293" facs="tcp:120106:156"/>thirſt, which was great, <hi>Shall I dye for thirſt?</hi>
               <note place="margin">Judg. 15.18</note> ſaid he —</p>
            <p>True deſires muſt needs be ſtrong — becauſe they come from the bottom of the heart, and riſe up to the top, and the whole force of the ſoul is united, and put into them,
<note place="margin">Iſa. 26.18.</note> and carried forth in them — <hi>The deſire of our ſoul</hi> (ſaith the Prophet) <hi>is to thy Name, and to the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>membrance of thee — with my ſoul have I deſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red thee in the night;</hi> hee means the whole ſoul. This is to ſearch for God with all our heart, which is a ſure ſign that we ſhall finde God, <hi>Jer.</hi> 29.13. the ſtrength of holy deſires appears,</p>
            <p n="1">1 In preferring Spirituals before Tempo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rals, Chriſt and Grace, and things above, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore Riches, Honours, Pleaſures, and all things here below, in being willing to part with our darling luſts, and whatſoever is dear to us to get Chriſt — to ſell all to buy the Pearl of great price, that is, Chriſt;
<note place="margin">Luk. 18.18.22 23</note> and the goodly pearls of Grace, which the Ruler that came to Chriſt was not willing to do, who pretended a great deſire to be ſaved, but pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferred his poſſeſſions, and his deſires to keep them, before his Salvation, and deſires to ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain the ſame — Deſires after Chriſt will make a ſoul ſay with that Martyr, <hi>None but Chriſt,
<note place="margin">John Lambert.</note> none but Chriſt.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="2">2 In exceeding all other deſires in us in heat, and height, in metal and edge, in ſwallowing up, or abating all deſires after earthly things,
<note place="margin">Exod. 12.7.</note> as <hi>Aarons</hi> Rod ſwallowed up the Magicians Rods.</p>
            <p n="3">3 True deſires are ſeaſonable for time,
<pb n="294" facs="tcp:120106:157"/>while the things deſired may bee obtained; what a man deſires fervently, hee will labour for preſently without delay, as the hungry man doth meat, and the thirſty man drink; hence proceeds ſeeking God early, to wit, while hee may bee found, and calling upon him while hee is neer.
<note place="margin">Pſal. 63.1.</note> — Deſires love not de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lays, either of pains for, or enjoyment of wh<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="2 letters">

               </gap> is deſired, for the accompliſhment of deſires is ſweet to the ſoul, but delays are bitter. — Though true deſires are never too late, yet late deſires are ſeldome true, as when men de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer their deſires to beleeve in Chriſt, to repent of ſin, and depart from ſin, till they bee ſick, or lye on their death-beds. — <hi>Eſau</hi> deſired the bleſſing, but too late, therefore hee loſt it, and his labour, though hee ſought it with tears. The five fooliſh Virgins deſired to enter into the marriage-chamber, but too late, when the door was ſhut.</p>
            <p n="4">4 And laſtly. True deſires of Chriſt, and grace, are conſtant, and continuall for dura<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, not by fits like Agues, nor by flaſhes like lightening, or ſtird only upon ſome Emergen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cies, or ſpecial occaſions, as hearing of the joys of Heaven, or torments of Hell, pathetically deſcribed, or of remarkable judgements of God, or from inward affrightments; for ſuch deſires (not having an inward root in the heart) commonly cool, and wither when the occaſion of them ceaſeth.— But true deſires, flowing out of the heart, are ſed with the la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſting ſpring of grace in it, the waters whereof ſhall not ſail. — They are reſtleſſe, never quiet till they be ſatisfied; unceſſant till prevalent;
<pb n="295" facs="tcp:120106:157"/>ever riſing and rolling till they reſt in the Cen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter of obtaining. — They that deſire Chriſt, and grace, pardon, and peace, &amp;c. aright, are not only importunately, but unceſſantly gree<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy for them, and will bee Gods Remembran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cers night and day, and give him no reſt, till hee give them their hearts deſires. — Neither delayes nor repulſes can cruſh, or quaſh ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cere deſires.
<note place="margin">Mat. 15.</note> See this exemplified in the wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man of <hi>Canaan.</hi> — Deſires are true when they are the bias of the ſoul, which inclines, or leads it the right way, <hi>ſcil.</hi> Chriſt-ward, Grace<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward, Heaven-ward; when they do (as by a proper Motion) carry out our ſouls freely, and conſtantly after theſe; as ſparks flye upward, as the ſtone moves downard, and waters run forward.
<note place="margin">Pſal. 119.20.</note> — <hi>My ſoul breaketh for the longing it hath to thy judgements at all times,</hi> ſaith <hi>Da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vid — and my ſoul thirſteth after thee,
<note place="margin">Pſal. 143.6.</note> as a thir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſty land,</hi> that gapes continually till God give Rain — So much for the firſt direction, for the right comforting of afflicted ſouls.</p>
            <p>The ſecond Direction is this, Caution them againſt four evills, to take heed.</p>
            <p n="1">1 That they do not diſhonour God in the time of their deſertions, and diſtractions, by unworthy thoughts of him, or hard ſpeeches againſt him, by murmurings at him, or quar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>relings with him, for his aſſaultings of them with Terrours, and anguiſh; for his with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>drawings from them of light and influences; and for his far diſtance, and long abſence from them. — Hereupon they are apt to think, and ſay, that God is not ſo loving, and kind, tender, and ready to help, as his word
<pb n="296" facs="tcp:120106:158"/>reports him to bee. — The Pſalmiſt when his ſpirit was overwhelmed, his ſoul troubled, and refuſed to bee comforted, then hee began to call Gods mercy,
<note place="margin">Pſal 77.2. Verſ. 7, 8.</note> Truth, and faithfulneſs into queſtion — <hi>will the Lord caſt off for ever? will hee bee favourable no more? Is his mercy clean gone for ever? doth his promiſe fail for evermore?</hi>
               <note place="margin">Verſ. 10.</note> — But hee checks him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf for it — <hi>I ſaid, this is mine infirmity,</hi> or this doth make mee ſick — It ſhould bee the chief care of Gods people, what ever they ſuffer from God, not to ſin againſt God; what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever God doth to them, to think, and ſpeak only the thing that is right, and to juſtifie God when ever they judge themſelves. — This was <hi>Jobs</hi> comfort and commendation in his great affliction — <hi>In all this did not</hi> Job <hi>ſin with his lips,
<note place="margin">Job 1.22. with cha. 2.10.</note> nor charge God fooliſhly</hi> — De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpair of Gods mercy is high treaſon againſt his Majeſty, and a flat denyall of his Deity. — Gods glory ſhould bee dearer to us than our lives, ſouls, or the ſalvation of them, and the more tender wee are of it, the more will God tender the comfort of our ſouls, and lives. — It was the frequent, and fervent petition of a Godly man in his tentations. — <hi>Lord maintain honourable thoughts of thy ſelf in mee.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="2">2 Caution, that they do not deſtroy their own ſouls, either</p>
            <p n="1">1 By denying what God hath done for them, to wit, the work of grace begun in their hearts, his love to them, his choice and calling of them (ſaying, they have no grace, they are Reprobates, caſt-awayes) whereby they bear falſe witneſſe</p>
            <p n="1">
               <pb n="297" facs="tcp:120106:158"/>
1 Againſt themſelves, which is unnatural.</p>
            <p n="2">2 Againſt the grace of God, and againſt the God of grace, his work in them, and good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe to them, which is moſt unworthy and ungratefull.</p>
            <p n="2">2 Or by refuſing what God would give to them, <hi>ſcil.</hi> grace, mercy, peace, and joy, wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full refuſal whereof, is wilfull murder (like cutting of the throat, or ſtabbing to the heart) yea ſelf murder, It isblood-guiltineſſe, yea guilt of the blood of ſouls, yea of their own ſouls; and ſhould not your precious immortal ſouls be dearer to you than all the world? la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour to convince them, that by ſuch a denyall, or refuſall, they make themſelves falſe wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſes, and murderers.</p>
            <p n="3">3 Caution,
<note place="margin">Joh. 8.44.</note> that they do not gratifie Satan who is 1 <hi>A Lyar, &amp; the Father of Lyes,</hi> becauſe there is no truth in him. 2 <hi>A Murtherer, ſc.</hi> of ſouls from the beginning, and will be ſo to the end. 3 <hi>An Accuſer of the Brethren</hi> (the children of God) unto God their Father,
<note place="margin">Job 1.9.</note> as hee was of <hi>Job</hi> to God, that he was an Hy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pocrite, or hireling — <hi>Doth</hi> Job <hi>fear God for naught? and an accuſer of God unto them,</hi> as if hee was a hard Maſter, cruel to cruſh poor ſouls under his feet, and took pleaſure in their deſtruction, or at leaſt that God doth not with them all the good, or ſo well as hee might. Thus Satan (in the Serpent) calum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niated God to out firſt Parents, of untruth, as if the word which hee had ſpoken in threat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning death was not true, <hi>Gen.</hi> 3.4. — <hi>yee ſhall not ſurely dye</hi> — and of envy, as if God had out of ill will forbid them that Tree; or for fear
<pb n="298" facs="tcp:120106:159"/>leſt by eating thereof they ſhould become as wiſe as himſelf. — Preſſe, and perſwade poor afflicted ſouls to beware they do not gratifie Satan.</p>
            <p n="1">1 By entertaining parley with him, as <hi>Eve</hi> did, which was the cauſe of her foil, and fall. — The old Serpent being full of all ſubtlety, will bee too hard for them. — It is the firſt game hee deſires to play with troubled ſouls, to argue the caſe with them about their ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rituall condition, to circumvent and deceive them with his wiles.</p>
            <p n="2">2 By hearkning to his tentations, and ſug<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geſtions, as theſe and the like.</p>
            <p n="1">1 To caſt off ordinances, neglect duties in publick, and in private (which are the means of grace, peace, and comfort) to hear, read, pray, meditate, &amp;c. as if theſe were needleſs, or to no purpoſe, and they ſhould bee no bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter for them. — This is Satans plot to ſtarve poor ſouls by cutting off proviſion from them, or them from it. This perſwaſion commeth not from God that calleth you, but from the Devil who ſeeketh to ſubvert, and devour you.</p>
            <p n="2">2 To harbour Jealouſies, and evil ſurmi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſings of God, or derogatory, diſhonourable thoughts, ſuch as Satan caſts into your mind, as if God was not mercifull, pittifull, faithfull &amp;c. — Theſe and the like ſuggeſtions are the bolts which Satan makes for diſconſolate, diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>contented ſouls to ſhoot at God; or a coat of diſ-honour, which Satan ſhapes, or cuts out for them to few, and put upon the Lord.</p>
            <p n="3">3 To caſt away their confidence, and lay hope aſide, and give over ſeeking, and wai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting
<pb n="299" facs="tcp:120106:159"/>on God any longer, and to throw them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves into a Gulf of deſpair. This is to do the Devil a real kindneſs, and to give their ſouls a fatal blow, for hereby they make them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves a prey to Satan.</p>
            <p n="4">4 To make a wrong judgement of them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves, and of their condition, by falſe Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſonings (which are Satans Sophiſtry) to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clude themſelves out of the ſtate of Grace, out of Chriſt, out of Heaven, as if they had no grace at all, becauſe at preſent they can ſee none in themſelves; or were not the Lords, becauſe they are ſo deeply diſtreſſed as none of his ever were.</p>
            <p n="5">5 To follow Satans preſcripts, or take Phyſick of him for the cure of Soul-troubles, which is to lay aſide all thoughts, or cares a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout Soul-affairs; to go into merry company, and to give themſelves to the pleaſures of the fleſh; which remedy is farre worſe than the diſeaſe. This is to leap out of the pan into the fire — Satans receits are rank poyſon. To hearken to Satan in any of theſe ſuggeſtions, or perſwaſions, is to do his luſts, and his works for him; to carry on his deſigns, which mainly oppoſe, and ſtrike at Gods glory, and the ſalvation of ſouls.</p>
            <p n="4">4 Caution. That they do not ſatisfie their diſquieted hearts.</p>
            <p n="1">1 By taking offence at the Lords dealings with them, or at their preſent troubled ſtate to be angry at God, or to bee froward and ſullen.</p>
            <p n="2">2 By giving way to ſad perplexed thoughts (ſufficient to ſink them) which is to prepare
<pb n="300" facs="tcp:120106:160"/>a Chariot for Satan to ride in, triumph over their heads and hearts, and to tread them both down to the duſt.</p>
            <p n="3">3 By venting, or juſtifying the diſcontents, and diſtempers of the heart, as <hi>Jonah</hi> did his Anger before God,
<note place="margin">Ionah 4.</note> that they do well to bee angry.</p>
            <p n="4">4 By putting away comfort from them, in a froward peeviſh humour, when it is tendred to them, as Children throw away their But<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter and Bread when they are pettiſh, or diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pleaſed, leſt the Lord deal with them accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to their deſert,
<note place="margin">Pſal. 18.26</note> and <hi>with the froward ſhew himſelf froward,</hi> and fill their ſouls with Wormwood and Gall.</p>
            <p>Third Direction. In dealing with afflicted ſouls (or with your own ſouls in ſuch afflicti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons) have ſpecial reſpect to Three Graces, to nouriſh and cheriſh the ſame in them which are their vitals in ſuch a condition.</p>
            <p>The Firſt is, Repentance for their ſins, thoſe eſpecially which are the cauſe of their trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bles, that their ſorrow may bee ſound, and deep enough, and go to the root, or bottom of their hearts, and of their luſts, that their ſouls may lye low in humiliation before God for them, for that is a foundation to build ſtrong and high conſolation upon; thoſe that are not rightly or throughly humbled for their ſins, are not fit for, or capable of comfort.</p>
            <p>The Second Grace is Faith; labour to che<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſh and ſtrengthen that in them by all means; to truſt ſtill in God, and his Mercies, and Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſes; in Chriſt, and his Merits and Mediation; to lay faſt hold on them, and to ſtay them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves
<pb n="301" facs="tcp:120106:160"/>by them, which are ſtrong refuges to fly unto, and ſure foundations, impregnable rocks, to relye and reſt their weary ſouls upon, what evils ſoever they either</p>
            <p n="1">1 Feel; So did <hi>David,
<note place="margin">Pſal. 42.5</note> Why art thou caſt down, O my ſoul, and why art thou diſquieted within me? truſt thou in God, for I ſhall yet praiſe him.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="2">2 Or Fear; So did <hi>Job, Though he ſlay me,
<note place="margin">Iob 13.15 Pſal. 56.3</note> yet will I truſt in him</hi> — And <hi>David, What time I am afraid, I will truſt in thee</hi> — Life is kept in poor ſouls, and their heads above wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, that they ſhall neither faint nor ſink, though the ſorrows of death compaſs them about, ſo long as the actings of faith are main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained, and incouraged in them, for Faith is their life — <hi>The juſt ſhall live by his faith</hi> — they cannot be overcome of any evils,
<note place="margin">Rom. 1.17</note> deſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, tentations, corruptions, or of the evil one Satan, ſo long as they beleeve; for, <hi>this is the victory that overcometh them all,
<note place="margin">1 Ioh. 5.4</note> even their faith.</hi> When faith fails, ſouls faint and dye away; when <hi>Peter</hi> began to doubt, he be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gan to ſink.</p>
            <p>The Third Grace is Patience; Perſwade them to the conſtant,
<note place="margin">Iam. 1.4</note> and continual exerciſe of Patience (that it may have her perfect work) in bearing his hand, ſubmitting to his will, in waiting his leaſure, for refreſhings from Gods preſence, for bringing their ſouls out of troubles, for an anſwer of peace, which will be life to their ſouls — So long as Patience is kept in work, Satan is kept out, and they keep their ſouls in their own poſſeſſion. — Tell them, that by giving way to impatience they
<pb n="302" facs="tcp:120106:161"/>give place to the Devil, who thereby gets within them, and gets great advantage a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt them; that heightens and greatens any affliction, and makes it grievous to be born — Let me adde, labour to cheriſh good deſires in them, that the ſmoaking Flax (or Wick) may b<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>urn, and ſhine, and grow up to a flame — When you ſee their poverty of ſpirit, that they ſee their Soul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wants, and breathe after ſupplies, tell them from Jeſus Chriſt,
<note place="margin">Matth. 5.3</note> that upon this account they are bleſſed, and theirs is the Kingdom of heaven.</p>
            <p>Fourth Direction. Take a right courſe for healing their diſtempers, and troubles of Soul.</p>
            <p n="1">1 By ſearching the Sore to the bottom, to finde out the core, and the cauſe thereof. — Till Phyſitians diſcover the cauſe of a Diſeaſe, they cannot apply fit and proper Medicines for the Cure; and by drawing the troubles of their heart to a head — as their ſorrow for ſin in general, to grieve for ſome one ſin in ſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cial, to let out the foul bloud, or corruption of the Soul; — as a Chirurgion ſeeks to draw a tumour or ſwelling in the body to a head, that the bad matter may iſſue out.</p>
            <p n="2">2 By turning the ſtream of their paſsions into another Chanel, as Phyſitians turn the courſe of their Patients bloud, when they bleed much at the Noſe, by letting them bloud in the arm — So labour you to turn their fear of Gods wrath, and vengeance, of Hell and Damnation, into the chanel of holy fear of God, and his goodneſs, of offending
<pb n="303" facs="tcp:120106:161"/>God, or ſinning againſt him — and their grief for paenal evils, inward or outward, into the chanel of godly ſorrow for ſin.</p>
            <p>The fifth and laſt direction is this, bear with their infirmities, as ignorance, frowardneſſe; Become all things to them for their refreſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, and recovery, like <hi>Paul,</hi>
               <note place="margin">1 Cor. 9.20.</note> who to the weak became as weak, that hee might gain the weak — ſtoop low in condeſcenſion to the loweſt ſtep of their dulneſs, and dejection, ſhew love to them with pitty, and patience to bear all, and hope all, — ſpeak to them as ſympathi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zing with them, as having a fellow-feeling of their troubles, and ſorrows, — make it out to them, that your words come more from your bowels, than from your brains.</p>
            <p>The ſixth and laſt particular caſe is ſelf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>commendation.

            <p>The third Caſe,

Upon this ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count <hi>Paul</hi> commended himſelf before the <hi>Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rinthians</hi> and <hi>Timothy,</hi> and all that read his Epiſtles to them, that hee might commend the great love and kindneſs of God to him, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore them all; and to propound himſelf as an example of Gods free and rich mercy to them all. <hi>I perſecuted,</hi> ſaith hee to the <hi>Corinthians,

            <p>Fourth Caſe is,

            <p n="1">1 To pray for us, as the Apoſtle did the Hebrews,

               <note place="margin">2 Cor. 1.11, 12</note> Why ſo? <hi>For our re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joycing is this, the reſtimony of our Conſcience, that in all ſimplicity, and godly ſincerity, and by the grace of God we have had our converſation in the World, and more abundantly to you wards.</hi> The converſion of ſinners,
<note place="margin">Gal. 1.24 Eph. 1.15, 16</note> and the graees of the Saints, are juſt occaſion of great thankſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giving to God.</p>

Firſt, In what ſenſe we are ſaid in the holy Scriptures to be perfect; we are ſaid ſo to be in reſpect of our being in Chriſt, of our juſtificati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, and ſanctification</p>
            <p n="1">1 In reſpect of our being in Chriſt, as our Head and Root, Suerty and Saviour; or as we are ingrafted and incorporated into Chriſt, <hi>in whom all fulneſſe dwels;</hi>

Therefore they are all imperfect in themſelves, while they live here below.</p>
            <p n="2">2 In reſpect of our Juſtification before God through Chriſt, which admits no degree, pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perly, but <hi>Unico actu ſimul &amp; ſemel exiſt it per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fecta,</hi>
               <pb n="334" facs="tcp:120106:177"/>ſaith Doctor <hi>Ames,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Ames, Medul l. 1. c. 27</note> that we are juſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied at once, and once for all; that all our ſins paſt, preſent, and to come, are remitted at once by the gracious fentence of God, abſol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving a Beleever from them all, though as to manifeſtation, ſenſe, and effects, or to the aſſurance thereof in the Court of Conſcience, it hath divers degrees.</p>
            <p>Other Divines conceive Juſtification to be a continued Act of God from our Vocation to our Glorification; becauſe while we continue ſinners we have ſtill need to bee juſtified, <hi>viz.</hi> to this end Chriſt continues his interceſſion in Heaven for us, to obtain the continued impu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation of his righteouſneſs to us, and a conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nued juſtification of us thereby; yet wee are not juſtified by degrees, or by little and little; but our juſtification before God (in the Court of Heaven) is perfect, at firſt, as well as at laſt. <hi>Downam</hi> of <hi>Juſtif. lib.</hi> 1. <hi>cap.</hi> 1. <hi>pag.</hi> 5, 6. <hi>&amp;</hi> 236. ſo ſoon as a Soul beleeves in Chriſt, with a true juſtifying faith, the righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſneſs of Chriſt (which is perfectly perfect) is imputed to him, and upon that account hee is reputed perfectly righteous before God un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to life eternal. Therefore the Apoſtle ſaith, <hi>Chriſt by one Offering hath perfected for ever them that are ſanctified;</hi>
               <note place="margin">Heb. 10.14</note> that is, perfectly juſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied and redeemed them, or purchaſed pardon of ſin for them, by that one full price of his bloud, once paid for all.</p>
            <p>Now though a Chriſtian be perfectly juſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied in this Life from Sin and Death, yet he is ſanctified but in part here (as ſhall be demon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrated afterwards) Perſons now juſtified be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore

Though the bloud of Chriſt cleanſeth us from all ſin, 1 <hi>Joh.</hi> 1.7. that is, from guilt by Remiſſion, yet if wee ſay that we have no ſin (ſtill dwelling in us) wee de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive our ſelves, and the truth is not in us, <hi>verſ.</hi> 8. or that we have not (or do not) ſin actually, we make him a Liar, and his Word is not in us, <hi>verſ.</hi> 10.</p>
            <p>Juſtification abſolves from Guilt, Curſe,
<note place="margin">Rogers practi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cil Catech. part 2. p. 123</note> and Condemnation, and acquits a Soul at Gods Tribunal, as fully and perfectly as if he had never tranſgreſſed; but not from all the effects of ſin, as the dominion and pollution of ſin. It doth not take away that vitious quality, or corruption of ſin inherent in the Soul, for that is the work of Sanctification, which is in this life imperfect. This is a diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence between Juſtification and Sanctification, the one cleanſeth us from all our ſins wholly, in reſpect of guilt, and obligation to puniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, the other purgeth us from the ſpot and power of ſin, but in part here, not wholly till hereafter. Sanctifying grace abates the power of ſin, but doth not eradicate the being of it in us; it puts down ſins reigning, but cannot wholly hinder ſins dwelling in us till we dye. Juſtification leaves no place to Condemnati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, no nor to Accuſation,
<note place="margin">Rom. 8.1. verſ. 33, 34</note> as appears by <hi>Pauls</hi> triumphant challenge, <hi>Who ſhall lay any thing to the charge of Gods elect? it is God that juſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fieth.</hi> — therefore it is perfect in this life. San<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctification
<pb n="336" facs="tcp:120106:178"/>leaves ſome place or room to cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruption in us (becauſe wee are ſanctified but in part here) therefore it is imperfect.</p>
            <p n="3">3 In reference to our Sanctification; wee are ſaid to be perfect even in this life in Six re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpects; to wit, of parts, of progreſs; of up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rightneſs, of furniture, of deſire and endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour, and of eſtabliſhment.</p>
            <p n="1">1 In reſpect of Parts; There is a Two<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fold perfection, the one of Parts, the other of Degrees.</p>
            <p n="1">1 Perfection of Parts.</p>
            <p n="1">1 When the whole man is fanctified, though not wholly; or is ſanctified through<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out,

Thus a Chriſtian is perfect in this Life, to wit, by perfection of Parts; in that all parts of him are ſanctified, Spirit, Soul, and Body, and that he hath all ſorts or ſeeds of Grace requi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſite to Salvation in him in ſome meaſure, as of Repentance towards God, faith in Chriſt, love to God, and fear of him, hatred of ſin, &amp;c. As a childe when it is born is perfect, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe it hath all the parts of a man both eſſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tial and integral, a child is a man for parts
<pb n="337" facs="tcp:120106:178"/>though not for meaſure or action. Upon this account he is call'd a man.

            </p>
            <p n="2">2 There is a perfection of degrees, Thus a perſon or thing is perfect, when it hath at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained to its <gap reason="foreign">

            </p>
            <p>Thus a man (not a childe) is perfect, when all the members of his body are grown up to their juſt meaſure of ſtature, ſtrength, and agi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity, and the faculties of his ſoul unto matu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity. Thus a Chriſtian is perfect, when he is come to his full age in Chriſt, and his graces and obedience are come up to their full growth and higheſt pitch of perfection, and he is ſo good that he can be no better; and all ſin or imperfection in habit and act, is utterly aboliſhed in him. Thus no man living is, or can poſſibly be perfect on this ſide the Grave, or before he come in heaven.</p>
            <p n="2">2 We are ſaid to be perfect here in reſpect of Progreſs; when we have attained to ſome good degree or meaſure of grace, and profi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciency in the knowledge of God, and practice of Piety, though it come farre ſhort of com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pleat perfection.

<note place="margin">1 Cor. 2.6.</note> Let as many as be perfect be thus minded,</hi> Phil. 3.15. <hi>If any man offend not in word, the ſame is a perfect man,</hi> Jam. 3.2.

            <p>Thus high acts of Graces (attainable in this Life) are cald the perfection of them; as,</p>

<pb n="340" facs="tcp:120106:180"/>call'd perfection, both in the Old and New Teſtament.

<note place="margin">2 Cor. 8.12</note> yea, God hath promiſed therein to accept of us in Chriſt according to that we have, and not according to that wee have not, even of the will for the deed; and not to impute unto us our imperfections. For God meaſureth not our new obedience by the perfection of our performance, but by the ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerity of our affections, and purpoſe of our hearts. In this ſenſe Perfection is oppoſed, not to imperfection, but to Hyprocriſie. A ſincere Chriſtian is a perfect, that is, a true real Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtian. An hypocrite is but the picture of a Chri-Chriſtian. In our militant ſtate, integrity, and infirmities are conſiſtent in the ſame ſoul. What is done uprightly is ſaid to bee done with a perfect heart,

            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Anſ.</hi> 1 Many things are commanded us to do, yea are prayed for, for us, and promi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed to us, which have their beginning in us in this life, but not their fulfilling, or full ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>compliſhment, till the life to come; which we muſt ſeek on earth, but cannot find to the full till wee come in Heaven. Let mee inſtance in four things, <hi>ſcil.</hi> Sanctification, Obedience, Vnion, and Glorification.</p>
            <p n="1">1 Sanctification. This God commands us on earth, 1 <hi>Theſ.</hi> 4.3, 4. — yea to bec holy, as God is holy, 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 1.15, 16. This Chriſt hath prayed for, for his people, <hi>Joh.</hi> 17.17.
<pb n="346" facs="tcp:120106:183"/>— <hi>Sanctifie them through thy Truth, &amp;c.</hi> This God hath promiſed in the Covenant of Grace, <hi>Ezek.</hi> 36.25, 26, 27. yet ſanctification (for all this) is but inchoated in us on earth, not per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fected till wee come in Heaven. The Grace of Chriſt is like <hi>Jacobs</hi> Ladder; it hath ſeveral ſteps aſcending, which reach up to Heaven; the foot whereof is on earth, it is begun in our Regeneration, and the top of it in Heaven, it is finiſhed in our glorification. This might bee exemplified in particular Graces, but I will mention knowledge only. Wee are commanded to know the Lord; and God hath promiſed, <hi>All ſhall know him from the leaſt to the greateſt.</hi> This is begun on earth, but not perfect,
<note place="margin">1 Cor. 13.12.</note> for here <hi>wee know but in part,</hi> but in Heaven <hi>wee ſhall know as wee are known, and ſee Chriſt as hee is,</hi> 1 Joh. 3.2. The know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge we have of God and Chriſt here, is the beginning of life eternal,
<note place="margin">Joh. 17.3.</note> but the end or Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection of it is in Heaven.</p>
            <p n="2">2 Obedience. Chriſt directs us to pray only for that, which God would have us to do. For Chriſt framed his plat-form of prayer he gives us in <hi>Mat.</hi> 6.10. according to the Will of God his Father. Now hee hath taught us to pray — <hi>Thy will bee done on Earth</hi> (by us) <hi>as it is done in Heaven,</hi> by Angels and Saints, to wit, cheerfully, ſincerely, holily, fully, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtantly, or as wee ſhall do it in the Kingdome of glory, when wee ſhall ſin no more. This Petition implyes, that no mans obedience is perfect; becauſe that wee pray for is not yet attained; the good things wee do wee cannot perfect them. Prayer preſuppoſeth both want
<pb n="347" facs="tcp:120106:183"/>of that wee ask, and Impotency in our ſelves to attain it, or that it is out of our power. A thing is ſaid to bee done, which is ſo in doing, that it ſhall certainly bee finiſhed.</p>
            <p>In doing Gods Will, wee ſhould indeavour to write after the coppy, and to come as neer the pattern Chriſt ſet us, or propoſed to us, as wee can here, though wee cannot perfectly conform to it, till wee come in Heaven.</p>
            <p n="3">3 The Saints Union or Unity. This is</p>
            <p n="1">1 Very much preſſed as their duty, <hi>Epheſ.</hi> 4.3, to 8. <hi>Phil.</hi> 2.1, 2. <hi>I beſeech you Brethren,</hi> ſaith <hi>Paul</hi> to the <hi>Corinthians, by the Name of our Lord Jeſus Chriſt, that yee all ſpeak the ſame thing, that there bee no diviſions among you; but that yee bee perfectly joyned together in the ſame mind, and in the ſame judgement,</hi> 1 Cor. 1.10.</p>
            <p n="2">2 It is prayed for by Chriſt for all belee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers, <hi>That they all may bee one, as thou Father art in mee, and I in thee, — that they alſo may be one in us,</hi> Joh. 17.21. — <hi>I in them, and thou in mee,

<note place="margin">Epheſ. 4.13.</note> and of the knowledge of the Son of God, unto a perfect man; unto the meaſure of the Stature of the fulneſs of Chriſt (which cannot be, till we all come into Heaven) wee cannot come to perfect Vnity in Judgement and Affection.
<note place="margin">Ioh. 17.23.</note>
            </p>
            <p n="4">4 Chriſt ſeems in that petition to have re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpect to the conſummation of this Vnion in Heaven, not only among themſelves, but with him and his Father, becauſe hee prayeth in the next verſe for their glorification — that all true beleevers may bee with him,

<note place="margin">Col. 3.4.</note> for ever.</p>
            <p>Though the Vnion between Chriſt and Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leevers here bee very near and ſure, and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diſſoluble, yet it is not ſo full and clear, nor perfected, untill wee bee joyned unto the Lord <hi>by ſight</hi> in Heaven, as wee are <hi>by faith</hi> on earth, 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 5, 6, 7. knowing, ſaith the A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſtle, <hi>that while wee are at home in the body, wee are abſent,</hi> or from home, <hi>from the Lord.</hi>
            </p>

               <hi>Luk.</hi> 13.24. Yet wee cannot come to this gate (to wit, of Heaven) much leſſe enter in at it, till wee dye. <hi>Paul</hi> laboured by all means, while hee lived,
<note place="margin">Phil. 3.11.</note> to attain to the Reſurrection of the dead, that is, to the eſtate of Grace, and Glory that follows after it, for both body and ſoul.</p>
            <p>Obj. 2 <hi>Did not Chriſt command or counſel the young man to bee perfect here, who asked him, Good Maſter, what good thing ſhall I do that I may have eternal life?</hi> Mat. 19.16, 21. <hi>Is not Perfection then attainable in this life?</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Anſ.</hi> Chriſts Counſel or Command to the young man, <hi>If thou will bee perfect, go ſell that thou haſt, &amp;c.</hi> was <hi>ſpecial to him,</hi> for Tryall, Conviction and Diſcovery, like that of God to <hi>Abraham, Go offer thy Son</hi> Iſaac <hi>for a burnt Offering, not general given to all.</hi> The man glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rying in his works (that he had kept all the Commandements from his youth up) affe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cted the praiſe of perfection, <hi>what lack I yet?</hi> Chriſt to convince him of his pride, errour and vanity therein, ſaid unto him, <hi>If thou wilt bee perfect, &amp;c.</hi> as if hee had ſaid, if thou art really that which thou boaſteſt thy ſelf to be, to wit, perfect, give a proof hereof in ſelling and giving all that thou haſt, and following mee. Or if thou would bee (as thou pretends) perfect, in Righteouſneſſe and Charity, then go and ſell all, and give to the poor, and come and take up the Croſſe, and follow mee. So <hi>Mark</hi> hath it, <hi>chap.</hi> 10.21. Or Chriſt ſpake this, to convince him of his imperfection, when hee boaſted of his Perfection. All theſe (Commandements) have I kept from my
<pb n="350" facs="tcp:120106:185"/>youth; <hi>yet lackeſt thou one thing,</hi> ſaith Chriſt— <hi>Sel all and diſtribute to the poor,</hi> Luk. 18.21, 22. Chriſt might have ſaid, thou art therefore guilty of breaking all the Commandements, becauſe thou bragſt, thou haſt kept them all, and thou therefore lackſt every thing, becauſe thou art conceited that thou lackeſt nothing.</p>
            <p>Having declared in what ſenſe the Saints are ſaid in Scripture to bee perfect; I proceed to the</p>
            <p>Second thing, That no man can bee fully perfect, or without ſin, in this life, which I ſhall prove by ſix Arguments.</p>
            <p>The firſt Argument. To bee fully perfect without ſin in this life, is contrary to Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, to Experience, yea to the ſtate of the Saints here.</p>
            <p n="1">1 To the holy Scriptures, which expreſly deny the ſame, as was declared before, 1 <hi>King.</hi> 8.38, 46. <hi>Prov.</hi> 20.9. <hi>Eccleſ.</hi> 7.20.</p>
            <p n="2">2 This is contrary to the univerſal experi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence of all Gods ſervants, who have felt and bewailed corruption in themſelves, even till death, and have acknowledged the ſame before God and man, and have diſowned,
<note place="margin">Iob 9 20.</note> yea diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>claimed all thoughts of their own Perfection in this life, as <hi>Job</hi> did; and <hi>Paul</hi> at large in <hi>Rom.</hi> 7.14. to the end, though a holy Apoſtle, complains bitterly of the ſinfull corruption that did cleave cloſe to him, and hang faſt upon him; and would do unto his dying day; and diſavows Perfection, when hee had been in the third Heaven — <hi>Not as though</hi> (ſaith he) <hi>I had already attained,
<note place="margin">Phil. 3.12.</note> or were already perfect. In many things wee offend all,</hi>

               </note> ſaith <hi>James. If wee</hi>
               <pb n="351" facs="tcp:120106:185"/>(ſaith <hi>John</hi>) wee Apoſtles who have ſeen and heard, and handled the word of life,

               <hi>verſ.</hi> 1. who have fellowſhip with the Father, and with his ſon Jeſus Chriſt, <hi>verſ.</hi> 3. who are cleanſed by the blood of Chriſt, from the guilt of all ſin here by our juſtification; yet if wee <hi>ſay wee have no ſin,</hi> not now in the ſtate of grace wherein wee are; no ſin dwelling in us, no remains of corruption in our nature, but that ſin is utterly aboliſhed in us, <hi>wee deceive our ſelves, and the Truth is not in us.</hi> We are not ſincere but Hypocrites, deceiving both our ſelves and others. The boſome-experience of all the Saints, is ſufficient to confute this vain conceit of Perfection here. The light, not on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly of the Scriptures, but of conſcience, or that light which is within men (if it bee not dark<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe) doth witneſſe the contrary to every man, — <hi>Video meliora, proboque — Deteriora ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quor.</hi> All the Saints will ſay, Perfection is not in us; wee carry a body of ſin up and down with us, in theſe bodyes of clay.
<note place="margin">Rom. 7.15.</note> 
               <hi>To will is preſent, but power to Perform that which is good, wee find not.</hi> Yea ſuch are the iniquities of our holy things, or our failings in beſt per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formances, as nothing but the blood of Chriſt can purge them away; nor ſave us from that condemnation, wee deſerve for them, though wee ſhould never ſin beſides. The beſt actions of the beſt men, cannot abide the ſtrict ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>amen of the juſt Judge, in point of Perfecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on (of ſincerity they may) therefore have they deprecated the ſame, as <hi>David. Enter not into Judgement with thy ſervant, for in thy ſight ſhall no man living bee juſtified,</hi>
               <note place="margin">pſal. 143.2. &amp; 130.3.</note> — and <hi>If thou
<pb n="352" facs="tcp:120106:186"/>Lord ſhouldeſt mark iniquities, who ſhall ſtand?</hi> Thoughts of our own purity and holineſſe, render us impure,
<note place="margin">Job 9.30, 31.</note> and unholy before God. — which ſome collect from that ſpeech of <hi>Job, If I waſh my ſelf in Snow-water, and make my hands never ſo clean, yet ſhalt thou plunge mee in the ditch, yea mine own cloaths ſhall abhor mee.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>God not only ſeeth but marketh their Ini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quitie, who think they can waſh themſelves from all ſin. Their very clenſing is their pol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>luting. See <hi>Jer.</hi> 2.22. Where the habit is im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perfect (as inherent Grace is here) the action cannot bee perfect.</p>
            <p n="3">3 This is contrary to the ſtate or Conſtituti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of all the Saints in this life, who have <hi>fleſh</hi> as well as <hi>ſpirit</hi> in them; <hi>and the one luſteth againſt the other, and theſe are contrary the one to the other,
<note place="margin">Gal. 5.17.</note> ſo that they cannot do the things they would,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Epheſ. 4.22, 23, 24.</note> — who have <hi>two men in them,</hi> an old man as well as a new; and the one muſt bee put off, and the other put on daily; and the doing of both is a work of time, even of their whole lives.
<note place="margin">Rom. 7.23.</note> They ſee <hi>two laws in them,</hi> one in their Members, rebelling againſt the law in their Mind, bringing them into captivity to the law of ſin. They have ſin as well as grace; the qualities of the Old and New man are complicate in every faculty of the ſoul, — whence ariſeth a continuall combate in them, like the ſtruglings between the Twins in <hi>Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bekahs</hi> womb.
<note place="margin">Rom. 7.15.</note> 
               <hi>So that the good they would do, they do not, and the evil, they would not do, that they do.</hi> They have <hi>two contrary Principles in them,</hi> from whence proceed two manner of Actions, Motions and Inclinations, continual<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
<pb n="353" facs="tcp:120106:186"/>oppoſite one to the other. Hence it is that they are in part carnal, and not perfectly re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>newed or ſpiritual here. Old things are done away, and all things become new in them, not on a ſudden, or at once, but by degrees. Grace imitates Nature, which in all Creatures that have life, as fruits of the earth, Birds, Beaſts, Fiſhes, is very little at firſt, but hath a vegetive quality put into it, to grow up by de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grees in time to its Perfection; and the more ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellent a Creature is, the longer it is before it come to its full growth. This is manifeſt in a Child. In like manner God gives his Children but a little Grace, a ſeed, a kernel, like a grain of Muſtardſeed, at firſt; but hee puts a growing quality into it, to make it grow up daily to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards perfection; and God gives them a charge to grow in Grace, 2 <hi>Pet.</hi> 3.18. and means to grow by, and time to grow in.</p>
            <p>Though Grace reign in them while they live, yet corruption prevails often, and will dwell in them till they dye, <hi>Rom.</hi> 7.17. There can bee no abſolute Perfection, where there are remains of corruption.</p>
            <p>Obj. 1 <hi>Why are Gods people called Saints, Righteous and perfect, ſeeing they have ſin and imperfection in them here?</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Anſ.</hi> 1 Denominations are rightly taken from the better part. As man is call'd a ratio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nall Creature, <hi>ſcil.</hi> from his ſoul, though the body bee a brutiſh thing, and void of Reaſon. As Wine having Water mingled with it, is called Wine. The heap is ſaid to be wheat, though there be chaff among it; and the Swan is ſaid to be white, though her feet be black.
<pb n="354" facs="tcp:120106:187"/>So a Chriſtian is ſaid to bee a Saint, and per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect, becauſe his better part is ſpirituall, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>newed into the image of God, and partaker of the divine Nature, The beſt part, gives deno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mination to the whole.</p>
            <p n="2">2 Upon a Goſpel ſcore, or the Covenant of Grace, God accepts and accounts them ſo.</p>
            <p n="3">3 That they may know whither they are to go or ſtrive; and not dream that they are come thither already, that is to Perfection.</p>
            <p>Obj. 2 <hi>Why doth God ſuffer ſin to remain in his people here, ſeeing hee is able to ſanctifie them throughout, and perfectly?</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Anſ.</hi> Though ſin bee evil in it ſelf, yet God ſuffers it to bee ſtill in us for holy and righteous ends, to bring good out of it, to us, and glory to his Name. Though Imperfe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction bee not ſo comfortable an eſtate, yet God ſeeth that it may bee ſafe and profitable for us, to bee incumbred with corruptions, and ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject to Tentations while we live here.</p>
            <p n="1">1 To manifeſt and magnifie the riches of his free Grace in taking away our Iniquities and receiving us graciouſly, in accepting our perſons, notwithſtanding our Imperfections and unworthineſs.</p>
            <p n="2">2 To keep our ſpirits humble, and make us vile in our own eyes, notwithſtanding all the Lord gives to us,
<note place="margin">2 Cor. 12.7.</note> or doth by us. <hi>Leſt</hi> Paul <hi>ſhould be exalted through abundance of Revelati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, there was given to him a Thorn in the fleſh, the m<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>ſſenger of Satan to buffet him.</hi> Which ſome conceive to be a ſtrong Tentation; but others, a Corruption edg'd with a Tentation.</p>
            <p n="3">3 To exerciſe our Graces continually, as
<pb n="355" facs="tcp:120106:187"/>Faith, Repentance, Holineſſe and watchful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe; to keep us in conſtant dependence upon Chriſt for Remiſſion, Reconciliation, and ſtrength againſt corruption; and for the mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tification of it; and to keep us in continual con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flict or war with ſin; and in uſe of the whole Armour of God.</p>
            <p>Second Argument. Abſolute Perfection was proper to Chriſt, &amp; is peculiar to Heaven.</p>
            <p n="1">1 It was proper to Chriſt, as he was man whilſt hee was upon earth, to bee perfectly holy and free from ſin; to have a fulneſſe of grace in the greateſt extenſion for kind, and excellency for degree. <hi>Hee knew no ſin,</hi> ſaith <hi>Paul,</hi> 2 Cor. 5.21. <hi>hee did no ſin,</hi> ſaith <hi>Peter,
<note place="margin">Heb. 4.1 <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="2 letters">
                        <desc>••</desc>
                     </gap>
                  </note> neither was guile found in his mouth,</hi> 1 Pet. 2.22.</p>
            <p n="2">2 And Perfection is peculiar to Heaven, and to the triumphant ſtate of Gods elect, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerved there for them. There only is grace made perfect in all degrees; and the will of God is done perfectly. There alone wee come to our full age, and full growth.
<note place="margin">Eph. 4.13.</note> 
               <hi>Vnto a perfect man, unto the meaſure of the ſtature of the ful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe of Chriſt.</hi> There that which is perfect is fully come, and which was imperfect is who<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly done away.
<note place="margin">1 Cor. 13.10.</note> There <hi>the Spirits of juſt men are made perfect,</hi> Heb. 12.23. Heaven is a high, holy, privileged place, where no unclean thing can ever come. There is no Tempter, nor Tentation, neither Sin nor Satan. To hold Perfection in this life, is to confound and jumble Heaven and Earth together, or the ſtate Militant with the Triumphant ſtate of the Saints; which are diſtinct in time and place, in order, meaſure and concomitants.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="356" facs="tcp:120106:188"/>
Third Argument. Thoſe that plead their Perfection here, and ſay they have no ſin, diſcover much ſin in their ſpirits, ſpeech and carriage, as ignorance, errour, ſpirituall pride, paſſion, uncharitableneſſe, Bitterneſſe, Cenſuring and condemning others, vilifying them by opprobrious terms, malicious cavils, and railing Accuſations. Rude, uncivil behavi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>our. Beſides, ſome of theſe deluded perfectiſts hold many dangerous, yea blaſphemous opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nions (as their ſcandalous Pamphlets, which better deſerve to be burnt, than to be read, do publiſh to the world.) They place Religion in trivial matters not worth the naming; and other things, which I take no delight to rip up or relate. Are theſe things, and the like, the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perties, or concomitants of perfection? Do they become ſuch perſons, as ſay they have no ſin? Do not their own mouthes condemn them? Are not theſe, and ſuch like, <hi>the Ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neration who are pure in their own eyes?</hi>
               <note place="margin">Pro<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>. 30 12</note> who fancy themſelves to be righteous, <hi>yet they are not waſhed from their filthineſs.</hi> But becauſe they embraced not the love of the Truth, God hath given them over to ſtrong deluſions, to beleeve the lyes of their own ſeduced hearts, and are indeed infatuated. They think they have light enough within them; therefore they reject Gods Word from being a lamp to their feet, and a light unto their path. I would gladly ſee the face of that man, who can truly ſay, I finde no darkneſs in my mind, no guile nor perverſneſs in my ſpirit, no diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>order in my affections, no averſneſs to good, nor proneneſs to evil; that canſay, I finde all
<pb n="357" facs="tcp:120106:188"/>that is within me ſweetly tuned to the obedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence of the Goſpel, without any jarre of cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruption.</p>
            <p>Fourth Argument. This opinion of perfec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion in this Life ſhakes the Fundamentals of Religion, and wounds the vitals of Chriſtia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity, and over-throws the Goſpel. For it takes away the need and uſe of Chriſts ſatisfaction, of Faith, Repentance, of Ordinances, and of Chriſtian watchfulneſs. They that ſay they have no ſin, have no need of Chriſts bloud to cleanſe them from ſin, nor of Chriſt himſelf to ſave them from ſin. No need of faith to beleeve in Chriſt for imputed righteouſneſs to juſtifie them; if they have a righteouſneſs of their own which is perfect. No need of Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pentance, if they be righteous and without ſin; for <hi>Chriſt came not to call the righteous, but ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners to repentance;</hi> nor of Ordinances, as the Word, Sacraments, Prayer, &amp;c. that they may grow thereby, if they be perfect already, or ſo good as they cannot be better.</p>
            <p>What need have they to keep watch againſt ſin that have no enemy, that are free from ſin? How ſoon and eaſily may they bee ſurpriſed by Satan, and drawn into ſin, that do not take heed to their ſpirits and ways, leſt they ſhould be led into tentation, and fall into tranſgreſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on; Security lets them in, but fear and vigi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lance keeps them out. <hi>Bleſſed is the man that feareth alway.</hi> He that thinks he hath no ſin, makes himſelf a prey to Satan; <hi>Let him that thinks he ſtands take heed leſt he fall.</hi> Is not this opinion of dangerous conſequence, both in reſpect of the Truth, and of the Perſons that
<pb n="358" facs="tcp:120106:189"/>hold it? Beſides, they that hold it, condemn the Generation of the righteous, as workers of iniquity, who are not of their way. The tree is known by its fruits, ſo are perſons and opini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons diſcovered by the fruits and effects of them.</p>
            <p>Fifth Argument. In every place of Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture where perfection is ſpoken of in refe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence to the Saints here, ſomething either go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth before, or followeth after, which expreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeth or implies their imperfection, and clears the ſenſe of thoſe places, as meaning perfe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction of parts, or growth, or uprightneſs, or the like; but not perfction of degrees, to be without ſin in this life. <hi>Be yee perfect</hi> (ſaith Chriſt to his Diſciples) <hi>Matth.</hi> 5.48. in chap. 6.12. he teacheth them to pray for pardon of ſin every day, as oft and as long as they need daily bread, that is, as long as they live; ſure<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly then his meaning is not, that they, or wee may bee perfectly perfect here, but that we ſhould ſtrive after perfection, and repent of and begge pardon of our ſins, to which we are ſubject every day, even during life.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Let as many as be perfect be thus minded,</hi> ſaith <hi>Paul,</hi> Phil. 3.15. How is that? as <hi>Paul</hi> was, verſ. 12. to think our ſelves imperfect, or that we have not already attained, <hi>ſcil.</hi> to our full meaſure in Chriſt: yet <hi>Paul,</hi> though hee was not fully perfect propounds himſelf to the <hi>Philippians</hi> as a pattern for their imitation. <hi>If any offend not in word, the ſame is a perfect man, Jam.</hi> 3.2. he means no abſolute perfection, or exemption from ſin, for hee had ſaid be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, <hi>In many things we ſin all. We ſpeak wiſdom
<pb n="359" facs="tcp:120106:189"/>among them that are perfect,</hi> ſaith <hi>Paul,</hi> 1 Cor. 2.6. Who are they? Such as <hi>Paul</hi> exhorts,
<note place="margin">2 Cor. 7.1</note> (joyntly with himſelf) to cleanſe themſelves from all filthineſs of fleſh and ſpirit (there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore they were not perfectly pure) and to be perfecting holineſs in the fear of God, that is,

                  <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>
               </note> by degrees; therefore they were not perfect already, or at once. <hi>He that is born of God ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neth not,</hi> 1 Joh. 3.9. but hear what the ſame Apoſtle ſaith, in chap. 1.8, 10. <hi>If we ſay wee have no ſin we deceive our ſelves, &amp;c.</hi> There<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the former text muſt not bee underſtood of a Saints not ſinning at all, or of abſolute immunity from ſin in this life, but of his not ſinning in ſuch a manner as the wicked do, that is, wittingly, and willingly, with conſent, and with delight.</p>
            <p>That place in <hi>Epheſ.</hi> 4.13.
<note place="margin">Epheſ. 4.13</note> 
               <hi>Till we all come into the unity of the faith, &amp;c. unto a perfect man, &amp;c.</hi> holds forth the perfection of the Saints, for number of Perſons, and for mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure of Graces in Heaven, as both the ultimate end, and the term of duration of a Goſpel Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſtery. <hi>When Chriſt aſcended up on high, hee gave ſome Apoſtles, ſome Prophets, ſome Pastors and Teachers.</hi> To what purpoſe?
<note place="margin">Verſ. 12.</note>
